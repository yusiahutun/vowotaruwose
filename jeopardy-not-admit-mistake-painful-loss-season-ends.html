">Read More on Jeopardy!</h2><p>"I still don’t know how I feel about second chances for people who won, especially dethroned a mega champ, but then couldn’t win more. They shot their shot and hit the mark. Just not as much as they like."</p><p>They continued: "Sadie [Goldberger], I agree with. but, hard to see an invite back for her. That’s effectively Jeopardy! acknowledging they screwed up or that the rule isn’t good as it’s written."</p><p>Another fan said, "They honest to God did Sadie dirty" while others called out the game show for making a "mistake."</p><p>Viewers were in Sadie's corner since the June 20 episode, when the former contestant was <a href=#>defeated during the Final Jeopardy! round</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2><strong>SHOCKING LOSS</strong></h2><p>It all kicked off with the Final&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;clue: "Congratulating her on the 1869 release of her biography, Frederick Douglass wrote, 'I have wrought in the day- you in the night."</p><p>After a short time, contestant Molly Fleming correctly answered, "Who is Harriet Tubman," adding $3,200 to her winnings for a total of $6,500.</p><p>Champ Megan answered correctly as well to increase her final game total to $17,199.</p><p>Sadie also appeared to have the same answer in mind; however, she didn't write it out in full.</p><p><a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>- who is <a href=#>sharing hosting duties</a> with&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>- said: "It looks like you were going for 'Harriet Tubman,' but you did not finish, so, unfortunately, that is not going to be acceptable."</p><p>Sadie nodded in agreement but seemed to look disappointed in the results.</p><p>She ended up wagering $7,500, which would have given her a grand total of 17,300 if her answer was accepted, which would have made her the new champ over Megan.</p><h2><strong>FANS' OUTRAGE</strong></h2><p>Fans didn't agree with the results and rushed to social media to share their anger.</p><p>One wrote: "Sadie was flat-out jobbed out of a win. I read it right away on the reveal as Harriet Tubman.</p><p>"They've counted Final Jeopardy! responses with worse handwriting than that."</p><p>Another said: "They've given credit for worse handwriting than that. Molly got credit without the question mark.</p><p>"I don't see how they can judge that as incorrect so quickly."</p><p>They added: "I've been watching Jeopardy! a long time, and this is the most suspicious outcome I've ever seen. I truly don't see how Sadie's response was ruled incorrect."</p><p>One viewer agreed and simply wrote: "She got robbed."</p><h2><strong>'PRETTY INCONSISTENT'</strong></h2><p>Hosts Malik and Ken were also slammed by watchers for their <a href=#>lack of enforcement of the rules</a> while recalling the supposed blunder.</p><p>"Jeopardy, this didn’t count, but then this one did?" one viewer wrote of hundreds after a recent episode.</p><p>Another tweeted: "I don't get it either. Jeopardy is pretty inconsistent with their rulings. That should not have been accepted.. the second word isn't even that legible!"</p><p>The official&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeopardy! website</a>&nbsp;states written responses to the Final Jeopardy! clue doesn't have to be spelled correctly to win, "but they must be phonetically correct and not add or subtract any extraneous sounds or syllables."</p><p>A third tweeted, "I’m trying to figure out their assessments, too."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>While a fourth accused, "The other major difference on these rulings is who was hosting at the time."</p><p>One person wondered, "I don't quite get why contestants don't have keypads for Final Jeopardy.
