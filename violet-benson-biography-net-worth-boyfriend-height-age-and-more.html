Her account is the largest funny female account that MTV had ever noticed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tellygupshup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1469110565-hbz-daddy-issues-fun-wine.jpg> Send Message<h2 id=family-and-relations class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">Family and Relations</h2><p>She was born in Russia, had been to Israel for a short period of time and luckily her family won a green card lottery and that’s when the complete family shifted to the United States.</p><p>Benson lives with her parents and her sister in Los Angeles. She has a cat as her pet, but unfortunately, she is allergic to it.</p><p>She has had a few relationships but at current, she is single and has not revealed any plans of getting married soon.</p><h2 id=education-and-career class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Education and Career</h2><p>She completed her education at California State University, Northridge, at the age of 20, where she was taught business law. The Instagrammer then started working in an accounting firm, fulfilling her father’s dream. She didn’t really feel like being herself there.</p><p>Gradually, on 5th July, she started an Instagram channel, posting all her life issues in a sarcastic and funny manner. This page named “Daddyissues_” got unexpected love from the users and her followers increased rapidly.</p><p>She was a guest blogger for MTV during the pre-show coverage for the 2015 Video Music Awards. She has also been a guest blogger for VanityFair.</p><p>The social media celebrity started her own show named “Top Five With Violet Benson”, partnering with Facebook. She also starred in a youtube series “How to lose a guy”. Violet also partnered with “Awesomeness”.</p><p>Later in 2019, Benson came up with a podcast “Too tired to be crazy” on YouTube, which focussed on topics like self-love and women’s empowerment.</p><a data-mil=47632 class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background" href=# style=border-radius:100px rel="noreferrer noopener">Add my biography</a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tellygupshup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Violet-Benson-Chloe-Bridges-and-Adelaide-Kane_-Violet-Bensons-Birthday-01-1024x683.jpg><h2 id=hobbies class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Hobbies</h2><p>Violet loves photography and traveling is what she would always want to do.</p><p>Apart from these, Benson has a liking which is not really common these days. She like people smiling and enjoying and what adds to her happiness is that she is the reason for many of those smiles.</p><p>She is a friendly person who loves to interact with her fans and tries her best to respond to each and every comment that she receives from them. Though it becomes hard for her to manage all these things she considers her fans a major reason for her success.</p><h2 id=way-to-success-with-social-media class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading">Way to success with social media</h2><p>Social media has been a great friend to her in her best and her worst times. Social media has given her the strength to put her thoughts to words and convey them to the world. At first, she had not revealed her identity to the world, but to be more attached to her followers, she decided to come forward and introduce herself to the world.</p><p>Social media acted as therapeutic and cathartic to make her realize that she was not alone and people did understand her. She has over 4 million followers on Instagram and 41K subscribers on her YouTube channel. Apart from this, she is also active on Twitter and Snapchat.</p><p>Personally, she is more into Snapchat, than Instagram. She was named “The Instagram Meme Queen” by VanityFair.</p><p>She gradually indulged in blogging, commercials, brand endorsements, and other business ventures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=struggles-faced-during-her-journey class="rb-heading-index-4 wp-block-heading">Struggles faced during her journey</h2><p>She has faced bullying since she was a child. She has had veneers in her teeth since she was 5. People made her feel disgusting for her looks.</p><p>There was also a time when she did not converse with many people. It was just her family and her limited friends, as she thought that the problems that she faced were not very common, people would judge her if she went up to them and confronted them. She believed that strangers are better in this case as they don’t know you and there is a high possibility of not meeting them again.</p><p>That’s when she created her Instagram page “daddyissues_”, discussing all her problems, making fun of them and that help her feel light-hearted. The rapid spread of that page, thousands of likes in a day, and people’s comments on them made her realize that a lot of people face the same issues every day. They could relate to her posts and showered their love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmislaG5urPUqaqhraBjsLC5jq%2BgqKSVqXqjsc2spqdlkp68qL7AqZ%2ByZZ6awW7DzquroWWSpManvsiepZ1lmJq2qLTTZpignV2Wu6V5zKipnmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fviolet-benson-biography-net-worth-boyfriend-height-age-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fviolet-benson-biography-net-worth-boyfriend-height-age-and-more.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fviolet-benson-biography-net-worth-boyfriend-height-age-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fviolet-benson-biography-net-worth-boyfriend-height-age-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fviolet-benson-biography-net-worth-boyfriend-height-age-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fviolet-benson-biography-net-worth-boyfriend-height-age-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./liz-larranaga.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./liz-larranaga.html>What Is Jim Larraagas Son Jon Larranaga Doing Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./valerie-bertinellis-talks-husbands-eddie-van-halen-tom-vitale.html>Valerie Bertinelli Talks Husbands Eddie Van Halen and Tom Vitale</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./valerie-bertinellis-talks-husbands-eddie-van-halen-tom-vitale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
