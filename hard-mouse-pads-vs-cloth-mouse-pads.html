You should consider these things when picking between a hard mouse pad and a cloth mouse pad so you don't regret your choice.</p><h2 id=the-difference-between-hard-and-cloth-mouse-pads>The Difference Between Hard and Cloth Mouse Pads</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mouse-pads-beside-each-other.JPG><p>The mouse pad isn't just something you rest your mouse on when you're gaming. While they aren't as important as the quality of the mouse itself, choosing the right one can help improve your gaming experience. But before we explain how you can choose the right one for you, first note the key differences between cloth and hard mouse pads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hard mouse pads are usually "faster", as in having less friction, than cloth pads. Because of their hard and smooth surface, it can almost feel like you're swiping your mouse on nothing. They can also be made from glass, ceramic, metal, or plastic.</p><p>On the other hand, cloth mouse pads are typically made from synthetic fabrics such as polyester. How the fabric is woven can also vary and affect the friction coefficient. Some weaves provide a smooth surface with low friction, while others have a higher friction surface for greater control.</p><p>You should also note that your sensitivity may change slightly because your mouse pad type can cause DPI deviation. Learn more about <a href=#>DPI deviation</a> if you're worried about how it will affect your aim and sensitivity.</p><h2 id=pros-and-cons-of-hard-mouse-pads>Pros and Cons of Hard Mouse Pads</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/white-mouse-on-glorious-hard-mouse-pad.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hard mouse pads aren't suitable for everyone, so many still prefer cloth ones. However, they do offer certain advantages for certain types of games. Here are the pros and cons of using hard mouse pads.</p><h3 id=hard-mouse-pad-advantages>Hard Mouse Pad Advantages</h3><ul><li><strong>Low friction</strong>: This is what most people buy a hard pad for. Tracking is more consistent than cloth mouse pads which usually induce jittery tracking, resulting in less time on target.</li><li><strong>Waterproof and easy to clean</strong>: Cleaning a hard mouse pad is easy; just wipe it, and you're good to go. A window cleaner will also do the trick if you want a cleaner finish. This is unlike cloth mouse pads which require washing and drying to get them clean.</li><li><strong>Better stability</strong>: Hard mouse pads are rigid and flat, so they distribute pressure evenly, making them stick better to the surface they are on.</li><li><strong>Extreme durability</strong>: Quality mouse pads like SkyPAD or Cerapad last very long. Their surfaces are hard enough that Teflon mouse feet don't degrade them. However, this does not apply to cheap plastic hard pads as they wear out in the middle where they see the most use.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-hard-mouse-pad-with-a-built-in-qi-wireless-charger.jpg><h3 id=the-problem-with-hard-mouse-pads>The Problem With Hard Mouse Pads</h3><ul><li><strong>Dust particles</strong>: Hard mouse pads easily collect dust, distracting you when dragging your mouse over them. While most dust particles are too small to notice, the occasional large dust particle that can get in the way. Thankfully it's easy to clean.</li><li><strong>Not easily portable</strong>: Hard mouse pads can't be rolled up or folded for easy packing. They are also heavier and might break when dropped, especially if made from glass or ceramic.</li><li><strong>Expensive</strong>: Quality hard pads are usually quite expensive. Unlike plastic mouse pads, materials like glass, ceramic, and metal are much more costly than fabric.</li><li><strong>Too slippery for precision shooters</strong>: Their low friction makes small hand movements and tremors obvious. It also becomes hard to instantly stop fast flicks and make minor corrections, resulting in overshooting if you're not used to them. Nevertheless, some top players prefer hard pads for precision shooters, so it's not impossible.</li><li><strong>Arm catching</strong>: Your skin may stick to the pad, especially in dry climates. This is a common issue with hard pads; you may need an arm sleeve to prevent it.</li><li><strong>Louder to use</strong>: Hard mouse pads will produce more sound when you lift and place your mouse back on it because of their hard surface.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pros-and-cons-of-cloth-mouse-pads>Pros and Cons of Cloth Mouse Pads</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/white-mouse-on-cloth-mouse-pad.jpg><p>Cloth mouse pads have been the standard ever since mouse pads were created. Cloth mouse pads have been used for over 20 years in the gaming industry and still hold most of the market share. Despite that, cloth mouse pads still have their pros and cons.</p><h3 id=the-advantage-of-cloth-mouse-pads>The Advantage of Cloth Mouse Pads</h3><ul><li><strong>Great for precision</strong>: Cloth mouse pads are great for games that require a lot of minor aim corrections and stopping fast flicks, such as Counter-Strike and Valorant. These games benefit from the high friction and control provided by cloth pads.</li><li><strong>Better pricing and availability</strong>: You can find quality cloth mouse pads anywhere. This is unlike glass or ceramic mouse pads, which only a few niche stores carry. You could even find great cloth pads for less than $20.</li><li><strong>Wide variety of speed options</strong>: You can find both control pads with higher friction or speed pads that perform similarly to hard pads. For example, if you want a low-friction cloth mouse pad, you can check the Artisan Shidenkai, which uses embedded glass in its fibers, or the Glorious Ice, which uses a special coating.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-cloth-gaming-mouse-pad-on-a-carbon-fiber-gaming-desk.jpg><h3 id=cloth-mouse-pad-cons>Cloth Mouse Pad Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Can absorb sweat</strong>: Sweat can leave cloth pads discolored if not cleaned after a while. Sweat can also affect the glide of the pad, making it inconsistent.</li><li><strong>More difficult to clean</strong>: cloth mouse pads typically need washing and drying for maintenance, so you'll probably have to game a day or two without it while it's in the hamper. You can also check out our guide on <a href=#>how to clean a mouse pad</a> if yours needs freshening up.</li><li><strong>Mouse Pad drift</strong>: Cloth mouse pads can move or drift if you're heavy-handed or put more pressure on your mouse during intense situations.</li><li><strong>Fabric friction can irritate the skin</strong>: The friction caused by constantly swiping the arm against the fabric can make your skin sensitive, especially on mouse pads with rough edge stitching.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=which-mouse-pad-is-for-you>Which Mouse Pad Is for You?</h2><p>Any decent mouse pad will always be better than using your mouse directly on your desk. However, it is also essential to pick the right one for the types of games you play and where you use it. Here are a few things to consider when choosing between them.</p><h3 id=types-of-games-for-each-mouse-pad>Types of Games for Each Mouse Pad</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sniper-elite-screenshot.jpg><p>If you enjoy playing high "time-to-kill" games like Apex Legends and the Sniper Elite franchise, chances are those require you to stay on target and track your target smoothly. If so, we suggest hard pads or speed cloth pads. Being as smooth as possible will help you stay on target for longer, which is essential for tracking games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you enjoy low time-to-kill games, CS: GO, where precision and stopping a flick quickly are key, then you want a controlled cloth pad with a little bit more friction. This also helps hold angles as the higher friction makes your aim more stable.</p><h3 id=the-convenience-of-each-mouse-pad>The Convenience of Each Mouse Pad</h3><p>If you like to go to LAN parties or bring your peripherals for events or hangouts, then a cloth mouse pad would be more convenient. However, if you stay at home and don't want to go through the process of washing a mouse pad, a hard pad is very easy to clean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lan-party-place.jpg><h2 id=smoother-isn-39-t-always-better>Smoother Isn't Always Better</h2><p>If you're not committed to playing games that require a lot of tracking aim, a controlled, medium-friction control pad may be the safest option for you. Many will find hard pads a little too smooth that it becomes hard to control their mouse. Unless you plan to commit to getting used to it or just want the convenience of easy cleaning, we'd suggest a well-reviewed cloth mouse pad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifmqqUYrqwwdKeZKmZlKh6t7%2BMnKOorJhiurDB0p5kqZmUqHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhard-mouse-pads-vs-cloth-mouse-pads.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhard-mouse-pads-vs-cloth-mouse-pads.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhard-mouse-pads-vs-cloth-mouse-pads.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhard-mouse-pads-vs-cloth-mouse-pads.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhard-mouse-pads-vs-cloth-mouse-pads.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhard-mouse-pads-vs-cloth-mouse-pads.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sean-mcgirr-alexander-mcqueen-creative-director.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sean-mcgirr-alexander-mcqueen-creative-director.html>Your first look at Sen McGirr's vision for Alexander McQueen</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hair-color-trends-spring-2023-7369642.html>The 8 Spring Hair Color Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hair-color-trends-spring-2023-7369642.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
