He’s named after the central character in The Godfather series. Since most of his family was in jail or dead while he was growing up, he was raised by his relatives or legal guardians.</p><p>In 2012, he was arrested for cocaine trafficking, according to the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/griselda-blancos-son-michael-corleone-still-faces-cocaine-trafficking-charge-in-miami-6520071 rel=nofollow>Miami New Times</a>. He was charged with trying to buy five kilos from an undercover detective using $10,000 in cash, a motorcycle, and a diamond necklace and pendant inscribed with the phrase&nbsp;Kill All Rats.</p><p>He was subsequently released from house arrest and starred in VH1’s Cartel Crews. He has also talked extensively about his mom in various media and has set to have a book, My Mother, The Godmother, and The True Story. “My mum had been balling since the 60s,” he told <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/griselda-blanco-sofia-vergara-netflix-b2051670.html>The Independent</a>. “Pioneer s***. Never again, that s*** was crazy.”</p><p>He recalled the day he found out his mother died, “It was a call I had been dreading for years,” he said. “I’d spoken to her at two that morning. They said to me, ‘Michael, I’m standing over your mother’s dead body.’</p><p>“Even right now it brings tears to my eyes because I was with my boys when I got that phone call. I was teaching my youngest one how to swim. I said, ‘I’m not going to let these kids live the life that I lived.’</p><p>“But to get out of that life you have to let certain individuals know there won’t be any retributions. It was taken care of in the old country, Colombia.”</p><p>Days before the premiere of the Netflix show, Michael Corleone, identified as Michael Sepulvedablanco in the lawsuit documents, and his wife, Marie, are seeking damages “in excess of $50,000,” as well as an emergency temporary injunction to block the January 25 release of Griselda.</p><p>Michael accuses the show’s creators of using his unreleased “artistic literary work” and his likeness “to depict the life story of himself and his mother, Griselda Blanco De Trujillo” without permission or credit, according to the lawsuit obtained by <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.etonline.com/sofia-vergara-sued-as-griselda-blancos-family-seeks-to-halt-release-of-new-netflix-show-218292 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Tonight.</a></p><p>The family made a statement to the site: “It is beyond dispute that Griselda Blanco made the ultimate decision for Michael Blanco, her son, to carry out and benefit from her life as it relates to artistic and literary productions based on her story. Although Michael Blanco is a public figure himself with his own rights to publicity, Mr. Blanco continues to honor his mother’s executed intent. Since 2008, Michael Blanco has worked extremely hard in the entertainment industry where he conducted numerous interviews and tv shows to tell his story. He is also the outstanding author of the book entitled, “My Mother, the Godmother and the True Story of Michael Corleone Blanco the Son of Griselda Blanco.” He published this book in an attempt to fulfill his mother’s wishes and tell the world the intimate details about his life and that of his mother, Griselda Blanco. It is a compelling story.</p><p>Michael Blanco was more than willing to share his hard work and the nonpublic details of his mother’s life with Latin World Entertainment/Netflix if he was to be fairly compensated. Make no mistake, Michael Blanco is humble and thrilled each and every time someone reaches out to shine light on his mother and the Blanco family. However, in the case of Netflix/Latin World Entertainment, the Defendants approached Michael Blanco to gain his work, perspective, and insight to only turn around and act like he does not exist, in an apparent attempt to reap their own profits. It is disappointing that Latin World Entertainment/Netflix would pretend that it is acceptable to use Michael Blanco’s commercial work without his permission.”</p><p>In a statement to DailyMail, he explained his <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13000747/where-Griselda-Blancos-sons-michael.html rel=nofollow>reasoning for legal action</a>, “I feel that it’s my duty to do it. And if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be keeping my word to my OG, to my mother. I’m just holding it down for the family – and I’m doing it legally.”</p><p>He continued, ‘I am a history buff so I believe that history should be told not only by the victors, but by the losers. You can call me what you want but I’m in both worlds. Some people will say, ‘You’re glorifying the lifestyle’. I glorify my mother but when you read my book and you’ll see my public apology to the masses, and to the victims of the 1970s and 1980s cocaine and crack wars. I’m apologetic because I myself am a victim… I buried 22 members of my family. I survived countless assassination’s attempts. Look at the way I lost my mother.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfnL%2Bqv8Slm5plkqGur6%2FOZqqopqNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgriselda-blanco-sons.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgriselda-blanco-sons.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgriselda-blanco-sons.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgriselda-blanco-sons.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgriselda-blanco-sons.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgriselda-blanco-sons.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./article-78c05180-e075-11ed-b093-6309d3af5f76-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./article-78c05180-e075-11ed-b093-6309d3af5f76-html.html>Martha Jo Hayes | Obituaries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./debbie-maveau-23-decapitated-hiking-himalayan-mountains-nepal-html.html>Debbie Maveau, 23, decapitated while hiking in Himalayan mountains in Nepal</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./debbie-maveau-23-decapitated-hiking-himalayan-mountains-nepal-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
