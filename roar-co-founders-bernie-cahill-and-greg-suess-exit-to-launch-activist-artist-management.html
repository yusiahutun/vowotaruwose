He will lead Activist’s music and talent divisions. Previously, Cahill was a co-founder at Roar where he established and ran its music division and over the last decade, he personally managed the careers of Dwight Yoakam, and Zac Brown Band among many others.

Cahill produced a number of critically acclaimed feature films and television programs. Cahill is a veteran of Billboard’s “Power 100” and “Nashville / Country Power Players” lists. He is currently co-chair of the USO Entertainment Advisory Board and he has quietly helped his artists raise millions of dollars for their nonprofits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Liz-Norris-200x300.jpg><p>· Suess will advise clients at Activist across a wide range of transactions, content strategies, seed and growth capital, strategic alliances, joint venture agreements, licensing agreements, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions, and marketing and distribution agreements. Previously, Suess was a co-founder at Roar where he established its corporate division and was a strategic advisor to Vice Media, and strategic advisor to, and investor in, Appetize, Cinedigm, Genius Brands, Influential.co, Ticketfairy and Virgin Hotels – Nashville, all of whom have joined Activist as clients. He will also continue to advise Activist’s clients in their non-profit endeavors; while at Roar, he led fundraising initiatives that resulted in more than $50M in funding for their various causes, including $35M for Zac Brown’s Camp Southern Ground where he is still an active advisory board member.</p><p>· Maher will head Activist’s Nashville office where he will continue to serve as the day-to-day manager for a number of Activist’s prominent recording artists. Maher was previously a partner at Roar and the head of the Roar Nashville office where he helped to expand the roster and build the music careers of Dwight Yoakam, Ben Rector, and Zac Brown Band in their rise from regional success to a GRAMMY Award-winning stadium act. Maher, along with Cahill and Suess, continue to be partners with Zac Brown in the award-winning Z. Alexander Brown wine label. In 2017, Maher was listed as one of Billboard’s annual Nashville Power Players. Prior to his fifteen years in artist management, Maher was an artist/songwriter signed to Capitol Records and EMI Music Publishing. Matt sits on the advisory board for the TJ Martell southern region in Nashville and co-chairs the TJ Martell annual “Ambassador of the Year” event.</p><p>· Norris, who was previously Roar’s Head of Media and Brand Strategy, will join Activist as a partner and head their New York office. While at Roar, Norris oversaw brand strategies for music and talent clients across all disciplines with a focus on music, film and television.
