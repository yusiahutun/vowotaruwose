class=mol-para-with-font>The study was led by researchers at the university's Department of Psychology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Women frequently send sexualised nude images to men, but women's motivations for sending nudes are unclear,' the researchers say.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We find that women are not thoughtlessly sending images of their bodies to others, but rather are acutely aware of their motivations.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As previous studies have discussed, sexting is a broad term and can include&nbsp;sexually explicit text, photographs, videos or even livestreamed explicit video chat.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For this study, the academics focused on nude photos ('nudes') sent by women to partners or more causal romantic interests&nbsp;– and their motivations for doing so.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The academics used questionnaires 'to understand women's motives for sending nudes', including more positive reasons, which have been underrepresented in prior studies, they say.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 207 women participants were all female college students from the US, aged between 19 and 27, who had sent at least one nude in their lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They were asked: 'As thoroughly as possible, please describe the reasons that you have sent nudes to

class=mol-para-with-font>Nudes were defined as 'sexual photographs of your body, or of a specific body part, in which you are completely or partially naked'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They could have been sent to a partner or otherwise, 'because people send nudes to non-relationship partners', the team say.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Responses included 'pressure from friends', 'being repeatedly asked for it until you gave in', 'to be fun or flirtatious' and 'as a sexy present for a someone'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Overall, the most common motivation by far, chosen by 35.3 per cent of participants, was 'relationship norm expectation'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This is when the participant judged sending nudes as an obligation or inherent part of being in a romantic relationship (e.g., 'This man is my boyfriend').&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The next most common motivations were 'because they asked' (20.8 per cent), 'long distance/separation' (17.4 per cent) and 'validation' (14 per cent).&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Additionally, a few women were motivated by a sense of power and control.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One participant said: 'I wanted to exert a sense of power over the men I sent nudes to; I could make them desire me and they would do anything to get a picture.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a few instances, women named violence or coercion as the reason they sent nudes (e.g., 'so he wouldn't break up with me or become more abusive').&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Women have many motivations for sending nudes, spontaneously generating over 20 separate motives,' the team say.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Relationship motives were the most prevalent while violent motives, instrumental motives and drugs or alcohol use rarely (if ever) spontaneously emerged as motivations for sending nudes.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They conclude by saying other researchers should consider using 'less stigmatizing language' when assessing women's motivations for sending nudes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The study was published in

an indecent image of themselves and sends it to a friend, spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend via their mobile phone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sexting is legal if it occurs between consenting adults.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, if a person is sent sexually explicit material and they are not wanted, the sender could potentially be subject to harassment charges.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anyone who has or sends indecent images of someone under the age of 18 is breaking the law.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So while the age of consent is 16, the relevant age in relation to indecent images is 18.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It is illegal in England to share an image of someone under the age of 18 in a sexual way e.g. naked, topless, in underwear, even if consensual,' John Synnott at the University of Huddersfield told MailOnline.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is also illegal for two people under the age of 18 to exchange sexual images and videos.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'While police would need to record the incident if they became aware of it they would likely treat it as a safeguarding issue if between two individuals under the age of 18 and in the absence of any coercion,' said&nbsp;Synnott.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Although obviously [this is] likely to be treated different if age gap was large (e.g. 11-17).'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, it is not illegal for two people under the age of 18 to exchange sexual text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Text only content is NOT illegal, provided it is not in breach of existing obscenity laws,'&nbsp;Katrina Miles, a postgraduate research student at the University of Liverpool, told MailOnline.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The term "sext" is a confusing one because it suggests "text" content and a lot of the academic literature talks about text-based content, so I try to avoid it and opt instead for Youth Produced Sexual Imagery.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Source: CareCheck/Cambridgeshire Constabulary/PSNI&nbsp;</span></p><p
