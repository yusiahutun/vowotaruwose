I’m not over him; I didn’t find someone else. I didn’t stop having love for him. I just spent time away from him for a little bit, and I was like, ‘Wow! I’m missing so much because I’m worried about you all the time, and I don’t want what you want, and you don’t want what I want.’ I don’t want to fix him. I can’t fix him. I tried.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Adams, who was 22 at the time, was met with criticism following the movie’s release, which he addressed on social media, saying, “Sometimes people disagree and don’t want the same things as one another.
