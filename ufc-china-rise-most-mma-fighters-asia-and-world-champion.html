But China has the potential to be the number one market in the world. We used to have offices in Singapore, but now all our Asian operations have been moved to Shanghai.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese fighters are disciplined and eager to learn, Amasinger adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They are easy to work with as a group. They respond well to authority in terms of what we’re telling them to do. They are also very humble, unlike people elsewhere who might have a prima donna attitude once they reach a certain level of success. They [Chinese fighters] are appreciative of the UFC experience and grateful for our facilities.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/13/3704aaf4-044e-11ea-a68f-66ebddf9f136_972x_060243.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Amasinger says that although Chinese fighters largely measure up to their overseas peers, they need coaching to streamline their individual fighting skills into a comprehensive whole.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Many people can wrestle, or strike, or do jiu-jitsu,” he says. “But the biggest challenge in MMA is putting those things together and making them seamless. The Chinese fighters do the individual martial arts very well, but they still lack slightly in integration. That’s what we’re trying to get them to do.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Shanghai academy takes in only Chinese fighters and currently has 26 athletes on its books, who train full-time and live in UFC-provided accommodation.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Conor McGregor’s comeback presser a shameful PR stunt</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alateng was its first trainee to graduate to the UFC division.

I do sauna and cold water therapy. I also use the other facilities, like the underwater treadmill. The coaching system in the Shanghai academy is also something that cannot be found in a local gym. I train with experienced overseas fighters from Australia and the UK,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/13/4f4c820c-01e8-11ea-ab68-c2fa11fa07a6_972x_060243.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The UFC, which has held four events in China and plans to organise at least three events in the country next year, entered the Chinese market later than its competitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Singapore-based One Championship, established in 2011, made its first big impact in 2015 with a tournament in Beijing. With offices in the capital and Shanghai, it has since held more than 10 China events and has more plans in the bag.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Amasinger also says that the UFC aims to build a pay-per-view market in China, like its US model. “With the time difference between China and the US, events held in China can still be popular in the US,” he says. “So an event held in China on Sunday morning can become a pay-per-view event on Saturday night in the US.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Viewers in China currently watch fights on subscription services. All the major streaming platforms, including Tencent and Youkou, broadcast live MMA fights. In April, China’s answer to Netflix, iQiyi, launched exclusive broadcasts from Bellator, an American MMA promoter based in California and owned by media conglomerate Viacom.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We want to elevate Chinese MMA to a higher level and we want to find out who the best fighters in China are ...

China’s original MMA promoter – the Art of War Fighting Championship – held its first fight in 2005 at Beijing Sport University.</p>The now-defunct outfit produced some of the best Chinese fighters to date, including Li Jingliang and Li’s mentor, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Zhang Tiequan</span></a>, who in 2010 was the first Chinese fighter to compete in a UFC competition.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the peak of Zhang’s career, MMA was still regarded as an extreme fringe sport and appealed to few Chinese. In 2012, when he fought Japanese rival Issei Tamura in Zhang’s fifth UFC fight in Tokyo, he travelled solo with no entourage or sponsor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His lone figure at the ropes contrasted sharply with that of Tamura. The Japanese fighter was surrounded by fans offering him drinks and mopping up his sweat. Zhang lost the fight.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other local MMA promoters include Ranik Ultimate Fighting Federation (2011 to 2014), Kunlun Fight, developed by Beijing-based Kunsun Media, Chinese Kungfu (CKF) and Wulinfeng, run by Henan Satellite TV.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/13/46bf4742-044e-11ea-a68f-66ebddf9f136_972x_060243.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Former Hong Kong Olympic swimmer Matthew Kwok has also become involved in the MMA scene. In 2014, he bought Legend Fighting Championship, a Hong Kong-based MMA promoter founded in 2009 that attracted fighters from throughout the Asia-Pacific to compete for regional supremacy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The last Legend event under its previous owners was held in 2013. After a five-year hiatus, Kwok and his partners relaunched the brand in 2018 with an event in Guangzhou. The next Legend event is scheduled for December 28 in Macau.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How Parkrun is taking over the world – but not Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwok runs a production company in the US that broadcasts sports events including National Football League games and Legend tournaments. He has now narrowed Legend’s focus from the Asia-Pacific to the Greater China region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After the relaunch, we are focusing on Chinese athletes,” he adds. “Li Jingliang came from Legend. We want to elevate Chinese MMA to a higher level and we want to find out who the best fighters in China are. While there are a number of local MMA promoters in China, their events can’t be seen on overseas channels like Fox Sports. We see a big opportunity in helping to develop the Chinese market.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2Fj2xubGliZMKnr4ycn6KmkWK%2Fqr%2FEZqSoq6Riuq6tjJ%2BgoKCkmr%2B0ecCsoJplkaOxbsPOq6OdZZOdrq68yKil</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fufc-china-rise-most-mma-fighters-asia-and-world-champion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fufc-china-rise-most-mma-fighters-asia-and-world-champion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fufc-china-rise-most-mma-fighters-asia-and-world-champion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fufc-china-rise-most-mma-fighters-asia-and-world-champion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fufc-china-rise-most-mma-fighters-asia-and-world-champion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fufc-china-rise-most-mma-fighters-asia-and-world-champion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./band-maid-announce-north-american-tour.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./band-maid-announce-north-american-tour.html>Band Maid Announce North American Tour</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./king-s-affection-ep-19-20-6-defining-moments-sums-tumultuous-concluding-episodes-967511.html>The Kings Affection Ep 19 &amp;amp; 20: 6 defining moments that sum up the tumultuous concluding episodes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./king-s-affection-ep-19-20-6-defining-moments-sums-tumultuous-concluding-episodes-967511.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
