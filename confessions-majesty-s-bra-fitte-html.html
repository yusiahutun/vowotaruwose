Or to put it more formally, in July 1982, I became the official corsetiere to the Queen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That meant using the Palace’s tradesman’s entrance, from which you walk for ten to 15 minutes through a vast and shabby basement.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-b2c57c08b821ae55 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/10/21/3E24AD7300000578-4302648-image-m-2_1489179703399.jpg height=420 width=634 alt="June Kenton (left) is the UK’s leading 'boobologist' and in July 1982, became the official corsetiere to the Queen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>June Kenton (left) is the UK’s leading 'boobologist' and in July 1982, became the official corsetiere to the Queen</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You go past the kitchens and workrooms, through the floristry area and finally, after what seems like miles of corridors, into the lift that goes to the Queen’s private apartments.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I’d imagined her visitors’ room would be full of gilt frames and gorgeous furniture. Instead there was a jumble of mismatched bits and pieces.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It looked like an old-fashioned dentist’s waiting room. At 9am precisely, Miss Margaret McDonald — the Queen’s dresser and former nanny — ushered me into the royal bedroom.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the same moment, a piper started playing outside — a tradition that began with Queen Victoria — and the sky darkened.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Suddenly there was an enormous thunderclap. Her Majesty calmly flicked on the main light switch, looked out of her window and said she hoped it wouldn’t rain as she had 8,000 people coming for tea.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eight thousand! All I could think was that if I were her, I’d be busy cutting sandwiches rather than bothering with a bra fitting. However, even the grandest ladies in the land need to be well-supported.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her Majesty’s thoughts were obviously elsewhere as she ordered the dogs be brought in from outside and only then did we settle down to the business in hand.</p><img id=i-74459449089ee8a6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/10/21/3C918F3400000578-4302648-image-m-16_1489180759471.jpg height=591 width=634 alt="During her first bra fitting with June the Queen said she&nbsp;hoped it wouldn’t rain as she had 8,000 people coming for tea" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>During her first bra fitting with June the Queen said she&nbsp;hoped it wouldn’t rain as she had 8,000 people coming for tea</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pipe Major MacRae’s bagpipes were still droning on when I finally retraced my steps to the tradesman’s entrance.

Tessa Seidon, who owned the last made-to-measure corsetry company in Britain, wanted to know if we were interested in taking it over.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rigby & Peller had been going since the Thirties, but it was struggling. The only selling point, in fact, was that the business had a Royal Warrant and had been providing corsetry to the Queen for 22 years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Was it worth the £20,000 we paid? Harold was dubious. But I was thrilled to discover drawers full of ancient lace and beribboned corsetry. (Several items went to the V & A Museum.)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We inherited four seamstresses, who made all the bespoke underwear for some generously endowed country ladies — many of them Ladies with a capital L — and for the aristocratic creme de la creme.</p><img id=i-6b67a77ab50c7cd6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/10/21/3E2256C800000578-4302648-image-a-4_1489179746401.jpg height=447 width=306 alt="Diana ordered swimsuits by Gottex, the Israeli designer, which June recognised in photos of her last fateful yachting trip with Dodi Fayed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Diana ordered swimsuits by Gottex, the Israeli designer, which June recognised in photos of her last fateful yachting trip with Dodi Fayed</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harold was worried that a few of our brilliant fitters didn’t speak well enough for our more upmarket clients. So he found a wonderful woman to come into the shop one evening a week to teach the girls how to speak the Queen’s English.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Far from being upset, everyone thought the elocution classes were fun. More important, the lessons gave the women a new level of confidence. For Royalty, I always did the fittings. One of our most loyal customers was Princess Margaret, who never wore lingerie or swimwear that wasn’t Rigby & Peller.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She often travelled to her Caribbean island home on Mustique, and was particularly fond of the boned Lollobrigida look (made famous by the Italian star Gina Lollobrigida) when it came to swimsuits.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I thought them old-fashioned and on one visit to Kensington Palace, I dared to bring along several lovely, Lycra swimsuits and cover-ups.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Princess Margaret wasn’t impressed. ‘I could not wear those,’ she sneered. ‘They’re synthetic.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She only wore swimsuits in her preferred style and fabric, she said — none of that modern rubbish. I decided not to mention everything we made for her contained nylon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Princess, I must admit, was very aware of her status. So was the actress Joan Collins, though she always made me smile.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She’d stand by the door as if to say ‘I’m here!’ — and God help anyone who didn’t recognise her!</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another regular customer was the Queen Mother, who granted me a Royal Warrant in 1993. She was great fun. Once, commenting on an outfit she’d worn recently, I told her: ‘You look wonderful in lilac, Ma’am.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She replied: ‘It was rather nice, wasn’t it? But I prefer myself in blue. When I’m in blue, and waving in the back of a car, people can see me so much better.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One day, I was with the Queen when her hat-maker arrived and it was announced that Princess Margaret was on her way.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-bf55686f42915bf9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/10/21/127DA481000005DC-4302648-image-m-9_1489180147038.jpg height=495 width=306 alt="June met Princess Diana in 1994" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-46a695b1e09ef6bf src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/10/21/127DA474000005DC-4302648-image-m-11_1489180162737.jpg height=495 width=306 alt="She says the 'never thought twice about coming to the shop'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>June met Princess Diana in 1994 and says the 'never thought twice about coming to the shop'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Queen Mother laughed and told me the Princess liked to interfere.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Shall I tell you what I do?’ she said, with a twinkle in her eye. ‘I pretend to listen to Margaret and then, once she has gone, I order what I want.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I didn’t meet Princess Diana until 1994, when I was 59 and trying to get fit for a charity trek. It turned out we both went to a medical and sports rehabilitation clinic in Chiswick, West London, every Friday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After several months of banter while we exercised, the Princess invited Harold and me to lunch at Kensington Palace, and we soon became friends.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Whenever we went to see her, she’d run down the stairs to meet us — and then we’d find bunches of flowers for us on our chairs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This was when Diana was at odds with the Royal Family, and I think she liked people around her who weren’t part of her rarefied world.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I never met William or Harry — though she was always talking about them. I gave her posters of models in lingerie and swimwear for them to put up in their studies at Eton.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On the phone, and she’d ask me to tell her in detail what I’d been doing — even if it was putting in some bedding plants. When she needed new lingerie, she’d ring up and say: ‘I’m coming to headquarters — will you be there?’</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/07/22/3E0E493800000578-0-image-a-38_1488925871907.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>She's grooving through those labor pains!
