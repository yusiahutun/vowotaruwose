They celebrated Christmas together more recently and before that in November, Jordan wished her a ‘happy birthday” all the way from Bali.</p><p>Before this, Emily dumped her ex Harvey after he cheated on her. Harvey apparently had bedded another woman behind Emily’s back and lied about it before he was caught out with an incriminating shot.
