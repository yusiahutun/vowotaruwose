However, some are persistent and require a different tactic. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unmatch feature</a> (Tinder’s speak for blocking) allows users to do exactly this. So, how do you unmatch someone on Tinder?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs1k3g3p3pf878.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fun and hilarious truth or dare questions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is a pretty straightforward thing to do. All you have to do is tap the red flag in the top right-hand corner of your screen when you want to unmatch if you are using an iPhone. Android users should look for an ellipses icon to reveal the unmatching button.</p><p class=align-left>The unmatching action is permanent, and everything disappears, including your conversation, once you hit the button. Also, your profile will not appear on each other's app while swiping. Therefore, if you hit the button accidentally, there is no way of returning things the way they were.</p><p class=align-left>You shouldn’t ever feel guilty when you choose to unmatch or block someone even before the conversation starts, as it is your app and your rules. On the other hand, don't even try to look for a guide on how to know you have been blocked on Tinder, as there is none.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, it is all about playing around with some of the app's features, and of course, if you are ignored long enough, you will know that the other person has blocked you.</p><p class=align-left>Are you looking for more information on how to turn off comments on Facebook posts and pages? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an interesting <a href=#>article</a>, providing more details on using the feature on the mammoth social media platform.</p><p class=align-left>The feature that allows one to turn off their comments is one of the most useful on the platform as it will enable one to avoid spam and stay away from negative feedback.
