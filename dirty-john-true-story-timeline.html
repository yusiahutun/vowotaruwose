When Debra Newell met John Meehan for dinner at a candlelit California restaurant in October 2014 following a string of uninspiring first dates, something felt different. He was handsome, charismatic, accomplished, and seemed genuinely interested in her. After four failed marriages, she felt maybe she had found "the real thing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But over the subsequent weeks and months, Meehan slowly revealed himself to be the very opposite: A pathological liar with an ugly temper, a criminal past, and a long history of conning, manipulating, and abusing women. In a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="six-part story for " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">six-part story for </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Los Angeles Times</a> and the accompanying podcast Dirty John, reporter Christopher Goffard chronicles how Debra's dream guy became a waking nightmare for her and her family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you haven't <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="read Goffard's articles" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">read Goffard's articles</a> or heard the podcast yet, rectify that immediately. Seriously. Do it now. With that disclaimer in mind, here’s a chronological timeline summarizing the key events in the horrifying true saga behind Dirty John.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>March 8, 1984</strong></h2><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Cindi Newell is murdered by her husband of 13 years.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Twenty years before the events of Dirty John, Debra Newell's sister Cindi was shot and killed by her husband, Billy Vickers. The couple was in the process of separating, and the murder took place in the kitchen of the home they had just sold in Laguna Niguel, California. Billy shot Cindi in the back of the head at close range, then shot himself in the stomach and called emergency services.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At trial, Cindi’s mother Arlane Hart testified in Billy’s defense, explaining that she loved him and did not believe he had been in his right mind when he shot and killed her daughter. Per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john-forgiveness/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The LA Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The LA Times</a>, prosecutor Thomas Avdeef was stunned by Arlane’s testimony, which he interpreted as painting Cindi in a negative light. “They threw her under the bus,” Avdeef said, referring to Arlane and other family members who gave testimony. “I don’t know the dynamics of the family. I could never understand that. Why say bad things about the victim?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The jury <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-02-02/local/me-9079_1_manslaughter-charge data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="acquitted Billy of murder" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">acquitted Billy of murder</a>, but deadlocked on the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, which Billy ultimately pleaded guilty to in exchange for a five-year sentence. He was released in 1986 after serving less than three years in prison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cindi’s death, as you’d expect, had a profound impact on her younger sister Debra. “It was the reason Debra hated firearms,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Goffard writes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Goffard writes</a>. “It was the reason she refused to have one around, long after people began warning her that she needed one."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>November 1990</strong><br></h2><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">John Meehan marries his first wife.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">John <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john-filthy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="married nurse Tonia Sells" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">married nurse Tonia Sells</a> at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Dayton, Ohio. At the time, she was 25 and he was 31, though he told her that he was 26. None of John's family attended the wedding; he explained that his parents were addicts and he didn’t want them to ruin the wedding. The couple had two daughters, and Tonia helped put John through nursing school.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>July-September 2000</strong></h2><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Tonia discovers the truth about John.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After ten years of marriage, John told Tonia <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john-filthy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he wanted a divorce" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">he wanted a divorce</a>. Tonia tracked down John’s mother, Dolores, though he had always forbidden Tonia from contacting her. Dolores revealed that John lied about his birthday and his full birth name, and that he had a drug charge against him in California.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After searching the Ohio home they shared, Tonia found John’s hidden supply of surgical anesthetic drugs, which she knew he had no reason to possess outside the hospital. She informed the police, who began an investigation of John in September 2000.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Dirty John, Season 1</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="Watch Now for Dirty John, Season 1" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KFYXCSK data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KFYXCSK data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KFYXCSK data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Now" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KFYXCSK data-vars-ga-product-id=809dc9eb-e802-4ce0-a752-96ed73b5e707 data-vars-ga-product-price=$19.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a96a4085-399b-4439-a872-e902a841bf27 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=TV data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=B07KFYXCSK data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Dirty John, Season 1" title="Dirty John, Season 1" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1547753255-41JmtzqfUWL.jpg width=500 height=375 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Dirty John, Season 1</h2></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>January 2002</strong></h2><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Another investigation into John begins.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dennis Luken, an investigator for the Warren County Sheriff’s Office in Ohio, began looking into John after hospital workers reported seeing him bring a gun into the operating room and steal Demerol he should have been administering to a patient.

The tension between Jacquelyn and John had worsened, as Goffard <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john-escape/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=writes class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">writes</a>:</p>He didn’t even want her seeing her kids, particularly Jacquelyn, who had been so vocal in her contempt for him. One day he caught Debra sneaking away to see her and said he’d throw Jacquelyn in the ocean if it happened again.<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Debra reached her breaking point in March, and filed to annul the marriage in April. John, now living in Nevada, began sending her threatening messages, demanding money and promising to ruin her. She requested a restraining order, but an Orange County judge denied the request. There was no imminent threat, they ruled, because John lived in another state and had never physically harmed her. She cut John off and stopped taking his calls and messages.</p><h2 data-node-id=65 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>June 11, 2016</strong></h2><h2 data-node-id=66 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">John steals Debra's car in an attempt to destroy it.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Debra’s Jaguar <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john-escape/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=disappeared class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">disappeared</a> from its parking spot in front of her office in Irvine, and surveillance footage showed John stealing it.

That evening, Terra returned home from work and parked her car in the lot outside her Newport Beach apartment building. As she got out of the car, John approached her from behind and attacked her with a knife.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=71 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He was trying to push me into the car," Terra told Dateline.

But as she and John wrestled on the ground, Terra was able to defend herself in part thanks to the heavy rain boots she was wearing, which had a thick tread. During the fight, she kicked the knife out of John’s hand, then managed to grab it herself and stab him 13 times, including once through the eye.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I just started stabbing him. I started to push him off of me and then I got him right here [shoulder] and I also got the last one in his eye and the last one I kind of did give a second thought. I was like ‘I don't want him to get back up, I don't want him to try to hurt me again. If he gets back up he's gonna kill me,” Terra told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fox5vegas.com/news/married-and-afraid-henderson-family-shares-the-story-behind-dirty/article_03ee39dd-3ba3-581e-8b31-0fa0ede3aa9d.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Fox5 class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Fox5</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=74 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After a neighbor wrapped Terra’s wound in a beach towel, Terra called Debra and broke the news: “I’m really, really sorry.
