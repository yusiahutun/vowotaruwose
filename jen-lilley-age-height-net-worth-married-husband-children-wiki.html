A place that’s been pinned on my @pinterest TRAVEL board since the beginning. God answered our prayers and held off the rain, I got to wear this super cute @shoppinkblush nautical dress on our private boat tour of the #almaficoast. Then I had the world’s best lemon risotto at #CostaDiva, followed up by the world’s hardest #hike. Okay. Y’all. All these bloggers who said #pathwayofthegods is “easy” definitely took the bus to the top first. Jason and I both thought we were going to die. We climbed over 150 stories of stairs. That’s over 2,000 stairs y’all. And I was wearing my @sperry slip on shoes, and my @shoppinkblush dress, a far cry from the appropriate, this grueling hike may kill you attire. But hey, minus the ponytail, I looked pretty darn cute with my sweat and my bump! And I totally earned the cheesecake I had for dessert after the 11 mile up mountain hike…where it was just us and some goats, and an Italian shepherd who told me this wasn’t good for the baby. Thanks Guiseppe! I’m only 3 hours in with the steepest cliff behind me and no way to get back down besides trudging on. ?? #welcomethirdtrimester</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">Jen Lilley</a> (@jen_lilley) on May 2, 2019 at 10:09am PDT</p><p>Currently, she is probably living a lavish life relishing a hefty sum of fortune she amassed from her profession.</p><h2>Jen Lilley’s Personal Life: Married, Husband & Children</h2><p>Jen Lilley married her spouse <strong>Jason Wayne&nbsp;</strong>on 26th May 2007, in Roanoke, Virginia.
