"He was a hockey player, a good hockey player, and we played hockey together."</p><p>"I hope this isn't indiscreet... but when they first made their big sale [on their Friends contracts] and were made millionaires for the rest of their lives, he wrote a big fat check to the foundation," continued Fox, who founded the Matthew J. Fox Foundation in 2000. "We were really early on and trying to find our feet. And it was such a tremendous vote of confidence. And it wasn't accompanied by any self-aggrandizing or anything, he was just like, 'Take it and do your best. And I loved that."</p><p>He added of Perry, "He was just a funny guy, and if I was ever as funny as him -- I mean, he was the funniest -- I'm happy I had an impact on him. He was a funny guy."</p><p>Last year, Perry opened up about how Fox was an inspiration to him when he was a teen.</p><p>"I was young, I had done a couple of plays in school, and Michael J. Fox was it, man. When I was in ninth grade, Michael J. Fox had just done Back to the Future, and there was smoke coming out of my ears, I was so jealous of this guy," he said during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>a November 2022 event promoting his memoir, </strong><strong>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</strong></a>. "And he had, at the time, the No. 1 TV show and the No. 1 movie at the same time! So he was huge. And I don't know anybody else who's done that -- except me."</p><p>On October 28, Perry <a href=#><strong>passed away </strong></a>at the age of 54 after an apparent drowning at his Los Angeles home.</p><p>Immediately upon the news of his death, social media was flooded with tributes to the 54-year-old actor, whose life and work had touched millions across the globe.</p><p>Many of the posts were from colleagues who had worked with Perry over the years, including his Friends family, who <a href=#><strong>released a joint statement</strong></a> following his passing.</p><p>"We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family," the cast said in their statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PEOPLE</strong></a>. "There is so much to say, but right now weâ€™re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss."</p><p>"We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family," they began. "There is so much to say, but right now we're going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss."</p><p>"In time we will say more, as and when we are able," the group continued. "For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty's family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world."</p><p>Perry's funeral<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> took place </strong></a>earlier this month, with the late actor being laid to rest at Forest Lawn cemetery in Hollywood Hills. His Friends costars were among those in attendance.</p><a id=gallery-link-017f852e-5cc1-4afc-899e-3f77c4f54b9d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:017f852e-5cc1-4afc-899e-3f77c4f54b9d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:36c3d03b-8c9e-4a2b-88b2-60593d97356c data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1b/4by3/2023/11/13/1b0b43aa88744c4db8ff2cd46c9897ad_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmamxforaktMCeo2aiXZu8uXnMmqutoJWserGx0auwZq%2BipMGmecGinmaekal6pLTEnKJmqJGnuKq60qilrGWWpMKvsMCtoKimXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-j-fox-matthew-perry-wrote-big-fat-check-parkinsons-foundation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmichael-j-fox-matthew-perry-wrote-big-fat-check-parkinsons-foundation.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmichael-j-fox-matthew-perry-wrote-big-fat-check-parkinsons-foundation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmichael-j-fox-matthew-perry-wrote-big-fat-check-parkinsons-foundation.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-j-fox-matthew-perry-wrote-big-fat-check-parkinsons-foundation.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-j-fox-matthew-perry-wrote-big-fat-check-parkinsons-foundation.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./qc-union-hits-milestone-with-record-apprentices.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./qc-union-hits-milestone-with-record-apprentices.html>QC union hits milestone with record apprentices</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./6623e017ca4741da168b459e-html.html>Kanye West est siendo investigado por golpear a un hombre que agredi a Bianca Censori</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./6623e017ca4741da168b459e-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
