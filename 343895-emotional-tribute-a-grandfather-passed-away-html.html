I will miss you dearly, grandpa.</li><li>Abuelo, you were my biggest inspiration, my role model, and my supporter. I knew I could always count on you. And though you’ve gone to rest, you remain my strength.</li><li>You were the most organised person I know. Your motto was, ‘ Always be prepared. I’m sure you were prepared for life after this. Sleep well.</li><li>I’ve always told you how special you were. You are full of kindness and love. Our love remains tightly knit, even stronger as we’re apart. Sleep beautifully, grandpa.</li><li>We always wondered what’s beyond the galaxy. But I’m sure you know it now. The sad part is there’s no way for you to tell me. I hope you found something good there. Enjoy yourself to the fullest.</li><li>I have beautiful memories of you to keep me comforted for the rest of my life. Thank you for making my life beautiful. Enjoy your new home, big daddy.</li><li>You were one of the most courageous people I knew. You dared life, and you’ve created impactful projects to show for it. I’m sure heaven is clapping to receive you.</li><li>You gave me a good life. You were a lovely person. Now be at peace and bask in heaven’s goodness. I will always love and miss you, grampa.</li><li>Because of you, the world became a brighter place. I couldn’t have asked for a better friend. Be at peace, grampa.</li><li>You taught me the value of trust. I’ve learned to keep my word because I had a trustworthy person like you. Thank you for all the ways you’ve impacted me. I miss you so much, grandpa.</li><li>You were always my anchor. Now I feel as if someone pulled the rug from under my feet.

Our grandpa showed us over the year that he did. Frankly, he was rarely wrong. We will miss your wise counsel, Gramps.</li><li>When you were present, we always felt happy when you were around us. Death has taken your companionship from us. Still, we know you’re having a good time in heaven.</li><li>From the way you have been treating us throughout our lives, you have made us understand that no grandpa doesn't treasure and adore his grandchildren.</li><li>The worst emotion is having to miss someone that’s no longer with you. We miss you badly but know you’re in a better place.</li><li>We believe that the most potent handclasp is that of a grandpa and his grandchildren. We will miss every moment we have ever shared.</li><li>Life has been different for us since you left. We are grateful for how much you protected us, grandpa. Have a feast in heaven.</li><li>In the years we spent with you, we came to realise that each generation rebels against its fathers and makes great friends with its grandchildren. You will forever be in our hearts.</li><li>Our grandfather taught us that all grandfathers are just old-fashioned little boys who love and enjoy spending playful moments with their grandchildren. We treasure all the beautiful memories we shared.</li><li>As we put you to rest this day, I am happy that you have shown me eternal love and happiness through the uncounted hugs and kisses you have been giving me. We will miss your presence, Opa.</li><li>You taught me so much in the short time we spent together. You taught me the value of the truest of loves that I'll carry it with me forever. I know that I shouldn't question God because He knows more than I, but I can't help constantly asking myself, "Why did he have to die?" I miss you.</li><li>As you go to be with the Lord, we promise to carry along what you loved most, waking up early. Enjoy the sunrise, which you loved, and we loved it as well.</li><li>You were such an inspiring person. You welcomed those who had problems with open arms. I’m sure you’re enjoying the harvest of your good deeds, Abuelo.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/98ecae6415b9b4f8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ fire Instagram captions for guys for your savage photos</span></p></a><h3 id=343895-emotional-tribute-to-a-grandfather-by-grandchildren class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Emotional tribute to a grandfather by grandchildren</h3><p class=align-left>Did your granddad pass away recently, and you have been wondering how to write a tribute for your grandfather?

Rest in peace, Opa.</li><li>Even though some fathers don't show affection to their children, there is no grandfather who doesn't love his grandchildren. Thank you for loving me, grampa.</li><li>Grandpas are such incredible role models in life. Through them, we get to learn and understand the gentle side of men. I am glad I saw that side in you. I love you, now and forever.</li><li>You were a person everyone wanted to reckon with. You’re so beautiful inside out. Death snatched you from us, helplessly. Goodbye, dear Opa.</li><li>Knowing that you’re no more is like going into any fight alone without backup. Rest in peace.</li><li>You will remain in our hearts forever, grandpa, since there will never be any other person who can replace you in our hearts and souls. We will always have a great love for you.</li><li>Pain in the body is inferior to pain in the soul. The pain of being injured cannot be compared to the pain of losing <a href=#>a loved one</a>. I’m missing you, Opa.</li><li>A heart that is made of pure gold has stopped beating. The most hardworking hands I know have been put to rest. This is one way of God showing us that he is interested in the best. I miss you.</li><li>Even if we searched the entire universe, we are sure that we will never find a grandpa who is as loving and caring as you were to us. Rest in peace.</li><li>Even if you are dead, you are not truly gone since your memories will live on in our hearts and minds. We loved you, and we will never forget about you.</li><li>My grandpa was the best teacher. Even though he taught me everything, he surely didn’t teach me how to live without him. I am broken beyond words by your demise, Opa.</li><li>To us grandchildren, you have been a perfect grandfather. You were never afraid of the fierce storms and the bibs dogs. We can only pray for a fraction of the courage you had. You are in our memories, now and always.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/afb27cb4ffdd3256.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Thank you for making me a mom messages, quotes, and images</span></p></a><h3 id=343895-tribute-to-a-great-grandfather-who-passed-away class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Tribute to a great-grandfather who passed away</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eb24f4b12a9da5f7.jpg><p class=align-left>You may experience waves of intense and difficult emotions after losing someone special.

Rest in peace, dear one.</li><li>My heart is torn, you live forever in this torn heart that seems never to heal up. I miss you so much.</li><li>I will miss my great grandpa’s ears that listened genuinely, arms that always held me, and love that was eternal. You had a heart made of pure gold, and you will always be in my heart.</li><li>To get the chance to see the children of your children is such a great blessing.

See you on the other side.</li><li>I am sad that I will never see you again here on earth, but I will surely miss your wisdom, encouragement, and inspiration. I promise to visit your resting place often with your favourite flowers.</li><li>Your death has brought us great sadness because we have lost a person who has always been there to love us and fix us when we are not feeling okay.</li><li>Saying goodbye really hurts.

Honour your late Abuelo with these short poems.</p><ul><li>A grandfather is the only man who has the ability to take up all her granddaughter’s problems and crumble them down just with one touch. My heart is grateful for the time we shared on Earth.</li><li>Grandfathers love their children immediately, but with their granddaughters, it is more abrupt and long-lasting.</li><li>Grandpas and granddaughters grow a bond that can never be torn apart by anyone or anything in the world. They help each other during their high and low moments. Even when the grandpa dies, their memories are left to last forever.</li><li>We had a wonderful grandfather. One who never really grew old. His smile was made of sunshine, and his heart was solid gold. He’s still keeping an eye on all of us, so let’s make sure he likes what he sees.</li><li>My grandfather is such a precious gift from above for us to love and treasure. Even when you are gone to be with the Lord, you will be in our hearts forever.</li><li>Grandpa, you were just a boy so many years ago. You had your loves and had your dreams. You watched us come and go. You watched us make the same mistakes you had made before, but that just made you hold us tight and love us all the more. We will certainly miss you.</li><li>There was a point in my life when I did not believe in the existence of heroes until I met my grandfather. I will miss you dearly.</li><li>We’ll always remember that special smile, that caring heart, and that warm embrace you always gave us. You being there for grandma and us through good and bad times, no matter what.</li><li>Even though your sudden death saddens me, I will be forever grateful that you made my childhood one of the most unforgettable moments in my entire life.</li><li>I will always hold you like the magician who created beautiful and unforgettable memories for your dearest granddaughter.</li><li>I loved my grandpa more than the fish in the ocean, more than the stars in the sky and more than the trees in the forest. I will miss you because you mean the world to me.</li><li>I know that no matter what, you will always be with me. When life separates us, I’ll know it is only your soul saying goodbye to your body, but your spirit will be with me always. When I see a bird chirping on a nearby branch, I will know it is you singing to me. I miss you.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ba82106a3ecd19b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sailor Moon quotes: inspirational captions about life and love</span></p></a><h3 id=343895-remembering-grandpa-with-beautiful-tributes class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Remembering grandpa with beautiful tributes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/98ecae6415b9b4f8.jpg><p class=align-left>One of the best ways to remember a loved one is to talk to others about him or her. Tell stories that make you smile. You can remember your Opa with these beautiful tributes.</p><ul><li>We will not forget our grandpa since no one will ever take his place in our hearts, souls, and minds.</li><li>Today we remember the life of Opa. He was such a model and example to us of how we ought to care for and love one another on this side of life. For this, he will be greatly missed.</li><li>Even though my grandfather is not here with me at this moment, we will never be apart until I take my final breath because you will always be in my heart.</li><li>Abuelo was a bold and God-fearing man. The greatness of his life we all celebrate today was built on godly principles and is worthy of emulation.</li><li>Throughout my life, I will treasure two memories that are so dear to me; your company and your infectious smile. I miss you so much.</li><li>Grampa spent a great deal of his life on Earth, impacting and investing in the lives of other people. He knew he had a gift and didn’t hoard it, but like a grain of wheat, he sowed it in the lives of others. We are all witnesses to just how much fruit this noble investment has yielded.</li><li>Even though our grandfather is no more, we will always be together in spirit until the day we will meet in heaven.</li><li>One word with which I could describe the life of Opa is influence. He was blessed with the gift of attracting people due to his nature. He could have negatively used this. Instead, he used it positively to help others find their purpose and goal in life. He will be greatly missed by us all.</li><li>I miss your love, hugs, and being happy. Even though I know the sun will still rise tomorrow, it won't shine as bright as before without you. Rest in eternal peace, big daddy.</li><li>History will always remember Opa for the key role he played in transforming the world in his time. He left an indelible mark for generations yet unborn to see and applaud. What a legend!</li><li>Even in death, we are comforted by your presence that surrounds us through the singing of the birds, the rising of the sun and the falling of the night.</li><li>The Lord saw my grandpa getting tired, and there was no cure, and he did the best thing ever, whispering come to me and take a rest.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5eaf695971c829a0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ heartfelt condolence messages for the loss of a sister</span></p></a><h3 id=343895-grandfather-passed-away-tributes class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Grandfather passed away tributes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/afb27cb4ffdd3256.jpg><p class=align-left>It is not easy to cope after losing a<a href=#> loved one</a>, especially a grampa.
