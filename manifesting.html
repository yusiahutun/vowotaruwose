I was smoking 20 cigarettes a day, in toxic relationships, and I didn’t make money for about 10 years.” With no purpose or motivation, she lived for partying because, in her own words, she had “nothing else to wake up for”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With a fair-weather interest in self-improvement, Nafousi would occasionally dabble in retreats that provided temporary wellbeing, but “nothing ever stuck”. After hitting one of her many rock bottoms, a friend suggested she listen to a podcast on manifesting. Something clicked. “Two weeks later I met my husband and, a year to the day, our son was born.” So too was her career. “I really immersed myself into researching self-development and the concept of manifesting as a combination of quantum physics, neuroscience, philosophy, spirituality and wisdom,” she tells us. Using all the principles she learnt, Nafousi then created a successful business.</p><img alt="roxie nafousi manifesting tips" title="Roxie Nafousi Manifesting tips" width=1886 height=2830 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/roxie-41839-mid-1674040948.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Roxie Nafousi</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to mental wellness, manifesting has become the decade’s woke buzzword. Some are familiar with it as a TikTok trend sparking memes (“shut up I’m manifesting!”), and it chimes with the latest social media trend '#luckygirlsyndrome' which is centred on the law of attraction. Others are reminded of the ‘90s affirmation movement played out through self-help materials. But the fact is, people have been manifesting for centuries.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Where I’ve come from is unthinkable, and I truly attribute this to manifesting<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Referring to it as a trend can do a disservice to it, because people then don’t take it seriously,” Nafousi notes. “I’m not here to make anyone believe it,” she adds, but rather to lead by example. "Where I’ve come from in two years is unthinkable," she told us in 2022, "and I truly attribute this to manifesting".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, it was a rollercoaster two years for us all. Nafousi held her first manifesting workshop just before the pandemic hit, with 100 people in attendance. A year later she hosted 700 people on a manifesting webinar. “I think the increase in interest is because people had no crutches left; they didn’t have the distractions of the pub, the shops. They also didn’t have the security that they maybe once had with their jobs. I think when people are lost, they search for help – and manifesting gives you hope.” Her debut book <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest/roxie-nafousi/9780241539590 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Manifest data-vars-ga-product-id=612c76d9-57e2-40b3-afd9-7accec7e75ee data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest/roxie-nafousi/9780241539590 data-product-url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest/roxie-nafousi/9780241539590 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fmanifest%2Froxie-nafousi%2F9780241539590" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=£16.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=fc4fa070-d7e0-418f-9a23-b2625cce54a7 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Manifest</a>, published in January 2022, swiftly became a self-care culture phenomenon, endorsed by the likes of Bella Hadid.

When done in unison, this framework can make for successful transformation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A common misconception is that it’s only about visualisation, but, as she explains, that’s just one aspect of it. “Manifesting is not about picturing what you want and waiting for it to happen. At the heart of manifesting lies your self-worth.” You manifest from what you believe that you are worthy of receiving, she explains. With capacity for self-love at the core, “you need to work on ways to cultivate this.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Manifesting is not about picturing what you want and waiting for it to happen<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One way is with a gratitude practice. “To have feelings of appreciation puts you in a high vibrational frequency state,” Nafousi says, referring to the quantum physics theory that “we attract the energy we put out”. Emotions with low vibrational energy (think fear, anger, shame, frustration) “can actually block you from having what you want”. In contrast, joy, peace and acceptance are thought to be high vibe and can do the opposite.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She believes you can change low-vibe emotions into high-vibe ones. Take envy – something that our comparison culture, amplified by social media, breeds. One of her seven steps is titled ‘Turn envy into inspiration’, which speaks to the notion of lifting others up.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“One thing that can really block us from our goals is comparing ourselves to others and feeling envious – whatever your focus in life, whether it’s being more successful or attracting your soulmate,” Nafousi says. She feels that envy tells you that if someone else has something, you can’t also have it because there’s not enough of it to go around; “it puts you in a place of 'lack' which you then attract”. The key is to instead be inspired by it. “It becomes an abundance mindset: ‘If they can have it, I can have it too’, leaving you empowered.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This all explains why manifesting is a lifestyle. “You don’t do it, you live it,” she says.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Iris Law: Inside my beauty bag" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screenshot-2022-12-14-at-14-29-53-1671028240.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, if you want to know how to dip your toe into the philosophy – or dive deeper into it, she does have some practical advice:</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>How to manifest</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>- Know your worth.</strong> As Nafousi emphasises, before trying to turn your dreams into realities, the art of manifesting starts with feeling worthy. “Work on healing old wounds with self-love and realising that you are deserving of the abundance that the universe has to offer.” Even the smallest daily behaviours contribute towards this. “What you do every day reflects your self-worth, which is the place you manifest from.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nafousi recommends journaling as a tool to unlock this. She collaborated with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://theheadplan.com/products/the-head-plan-x-roxie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Head Plan on The Journal by Roxie Nafousi" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Head Plan on The Journal by Roxie Nafousi</a>, a guided programme over 12 weeks. “It’s the ultimate manifesting tool,” she says. And, of course, her second book <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest-dive-deeper/roxie-nafousi/9780241608005? data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Manifest: Dive Deeper" data-vars-ga-product-id=dc877d71-8b8c-4509-8115-4f63518492a7 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest-dive-deeper/roxie-nafousi/9780241608005? data-product-url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest-dive-deeper/roxie-nafousi/9780241608005? data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fmanifest-dive-deeper%2Froxie-nafousi%2F9780241608005%3F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=£16.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a02490e1-5ca3-4565-bd19-46f95911fc94 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Thrillers class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Manifest: Dive Deeper</a> enables this too, with space for readers to document their own journey throughout the pages.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>- Create a vision board.</strong> A physical visual representation of your goals is recommended to help you “get clarity on what you want your life to look like,” she explains. When doing this, allow yourself to dream big. “Make sure you’re not already limiting yourself because you can’t believe you can have something.” Try her tips for creating a vision board shared on Instagram, below:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>- </strong><strong>Do the work.</strong> Now you need to take action and be proactive about achieving your goals. “There’s no substitute for effort. As much as you need to visualise what you want – say, a promotion – you also need to apply yourself and work hard. Be courageous and step outside your comfort zone.” You’re less likely to see this on TikTok. “You can’t just do something in a day; you have to live-and-breathe this stuff, and then you can unlock infinite abundance.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>- </strong><strong>Trust when things go wrong.</strong> Another one of Nafousi’s seven steps is about overcoming tests from the universe. “Manifesting is not magic! It brings a magical feeling, because it can feel like miracles are happening around you, but it’s also part of life which comes with imperfection.” Instead of feeling failure when you don’t get what you want (the job, the partner, the property…) remain optimistic. “Knowing that something better is waiting for you is a really powerful way to attract more abundance,” Nafousi feels. In time, “you’re able to deal with rejection or something going wrong with greater ease because you know you’re still on your right path and are using it to build resilience.” That trust, she says, is what really rewards you.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Roxie's manifesting resources</strong></h2><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Manifest: Dive Deeper (Hardback)</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£17 at Waterstones for Manifest: Dive Deeper (Hardback)" data-href=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest-dive-deeper/roxie-nafousi/9780241608005? data-product-url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest-dive-deeper/roxie-nafousi/9780241608005? data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fmanifest-dive-deeper%2Froxie-nafousi%2F9780241608005%3F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£17 at Waterstones" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/manifest-dive-deeper/roxie-nafousi/9780241608005? data-vars-ga-product-id=28db9490-3aa1-4e3d-93cc-8bdc4f11d316 data-vars-ga-product-price=£16.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a02490e1-5ca3-4565-bd19-46f95911fc94 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Thrillers data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=9780241608005 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Manifest: Dive Deeper (Hardback)" title="Manifest: Dive Deeper (Hardback)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1672922950-9780241608005.jpg width=286 height=400 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Manifest: Dive Deeper (Hardback)</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nafousi wrote her books because she wanted to create a framework that people could follow – resources she felt were lacking from the work of manifesting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition to the inspiring guides, there are other resources she’s personally found helpful.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Look out for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/drjoedispenza/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Joe Dispenza" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Joe Dispenza</a>, “who really talks about how we can use the power of our mind and the way our body behaves to change,” and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/loveabrahamhicks/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Abraham Hicks" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Abraham Hicks</a> (a collective consciousness channelled by Esther Hicks), “one of the first to talk about manifesting”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then there’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/oprah/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Oprah class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Oprah</a>, with her eternal words of wisdom.
