<time>09 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>For years, royal followers have been fascinated with <a href=# rel=noopener>Prince Harry’s net worth</a>. The fascination grew even more after the Duke of Sussex and his wife, Meghan Markle, announced their decision to take a step back from the British royal family to move from London to North America in January 2020.</p><p>“After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,” Meghan and Harry wrote on their Instagram at the time. “We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen. It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>After the couple left Kensington Palace, the two moved to <a href=# rel=noopener>Canada</a>, where Meghan lived as she filmed her USA Today TV series, Suits. From there, the couple relocated to <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles</a> before finding a home in <a href=# rel=noopener>Montecito</a>, a neighborhood in <a href=# rel=noopener>Santa Barbara, California</a>, where they live with their son, <a href=# rel=noopener>Archie Harrison Mountbatten Windsor</a>. Fascination around Meghan and Harry’s post-royals life sparked again in March 2021 when the two were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey for CBS’ <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah With Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special</a>.</p><p>Though there was speculation at the time that Meghan and Harry were paid for the interview, Page Six confirmed that the couple didn’t receive any money for the special. “A spokeswoman for the Oprah Winfrey Network confirmed that the couple won’t be collecting a paycheck and said that no donations are being made to their charity,” Page Six reported at the time.</p><p>With that said, there are still a lot of question marks around <a href=# id=auto-tag_prince-harry data-tag=prince-harry>Prince Harry</a>‘s <a href=# id=auto-tag_net-worth data-tag=net-worth>net worth</a>. Read on for what we know about Prince Harry’s net worth and how the Duke of Sussex makes his money after his royal exit.</p><h2>How much were Prince Harry’s annual allowances?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/prince-charles-prince-harry.jpg><p>How much were Prince Harry’s annual allowances? According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, 95 percent of Harry’s income before he left the royal family came from his father, King Charles III, who at the time controlled the Duchy of Cornwall, a portfolio of property and financial investments that brought in £21.6 million&nbsp; (or $29.8 million) in 2019. From 2018 to 2018, Harry’s annual allowance from Duchy, which he shared with Meghan, was £5 million or $6.9 million. This paid for Harry and Meghan’s public duties as working members of the royal family, such as wardrobe and travel, as well as private costs.</p><p>The other 5 percent of Harry’s income came from the Sovereign Grant, which is tax-payer funded and paid from the government to the royal family to cover expenses for official duties, as well as the royal palace. According to the BBC, the grant, which is also funded from crown estate profits and commercial properties owned by the crown, is worth £82.4 million (or $114,004 million.)</p><p>However, after Meghan and Harry left the royals, they announced their plan to be “financially independent” and no longer take money from streams like the Sovereign Grant. “They will no longer receive public funds for Royal duties,” Kensington Palace said in a statement in September 2020.</p><h2>How much did Prince Harry inherit from Princess Diana?</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/princess-diana-prince-harry-prince-william-1.jpg></p><p>How much did Prince Harry inherit from Princess Diana? Diana, the Princess of Wales, died on August 31, 1997. She was 36 years old. After the death of their mother, Harry and his older brother, Prince William inherited part of their mother’s estate on their 25th birthdays, which was around $10 million each, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes.</a> In his interview on Oprah With Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special in March 2021, Harry revealed that he used his trust from his mother to support him and his family after his father, Prince Charles, cut him off financially at the start of 2020 following Harry and Meghan’s exit from the British royal family and move to the United States. “I had to afford security for us,” Harry said at the time. “[I was cut off] in the first quarter of 2020. But I’ve got what my mom left me and without that, we would not have been able to do this.”</p><p>According to Us Weekly, though Diana’s will stated that her estate would be distributed to William and Harry when they turned 25, the funds were held until they were 30. Despite the hold, the brothers were still able to receive interest on their trust funds earlier.&nbsp;While Harry and William were the chief heirs of Diana’s estate, the People’s Princess’ will also listed others whom she wanted to share her wealth, including her butler, Paul Burrell, as well as 17 of her godchildren, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Worthy</a>.</p><h2>How much did Prince Harry inherit from Queen Elizabeth II?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/prince-harry-queen-elizabeth.jpg><p>How much did Prince Harry inherit from Queen Elizabeth II? The Queen died on September 8, 2022. She was 96 years old. It’s unclear what Harry inherited from the Queen, however, CNN reported at the time of the Queen’s death that&nbsp; Prince William inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate worth around $1.2 billion. The estate—which belonged to William’s father, King Charles III, before he took the throne—covers 140,000 acres in the United Kingdom and is used “used to fund the public, private and charitable activities” of the Duke of Cornwall, the title William inherited after the Queen’s death.</p><p>The Duchy of Cornwall was established in 1337 to financially support the heir to the throne, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">CNN</a>. The Duchy of Cornwall—which will provide the income for Prince William and Kate Middleton—is funded through the ownership and operation of land in rural and urban areas, as well as islands and rental cottages in Wales, Cornwall and other areas in the United Kingdom. In 2018, the Duchy of Cornwall made Charles and Camilla $28 million, which is around what William and Kate will make as well. According to CNN, about 50 percent of Charles and Camilla’s annual income was spent on travel and official royal engagements, while a quarter went to taxes. The remaining $8.9 million went to Charles’ children with his late wife Princess Diana—Prince William and Prince Harry—as well as non-official purchases and a royal savings account.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Radar Online</a> also reported in September 2022 that Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle, and daughter, Lilibet Diana, were left out of the Queen’s inheritance. “There’s a very good chance the Queen won’t leave either of them any jewels of value,” a source said. “It’s not surprising, since they’re not members of the royal family anymore, but it would be a real slap in the face.” Radar Online also reported that Meghan’s sister-in-law, Kate,&nbsp; who was set to inherit $110 million in jewelry from the Queen, will likely pass some of her jewels to her niece because she and William, “really don’t want Lilibet to be left out.” “As for Meghan, she’s not their concern,” the insider added. As for why the Queen left Meghan out of her inheritance, Radar Online’s source speculated that it could be due to either “practicality” or Harry and Meghan’s drama with the British royal family in the years leading up to the Queen’s death. “Some people think it won’t be out of spite, but practicality,” the insider said. “Others say it would be the Queen sending a message to Meghan and Harry: You reap what you sow.”</p><h2>What is Prince Harry’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1425152892.jpg><p>What is Prince Harry’s net worth? Prince Harry’s net worth is $60 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;According to a 2021 report by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, Meghan and Harry had a combined net worth at the time of $10 million. The magazine also reported that the two had a “nest egg” of $5 million after they bought their $14.7 million house in Montecito, California, in August 2020. (In comparison, Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was worth $500 million with money from the British Monarch holdings, the Crown Estate and the Duchy of Lancaster before her death, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>.)</p><p>So how did Prince Harry make money after he left the royal family? Well, one source of income was from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s massive Netflix deal in 2020. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a>, Harry and Meghan signed a deal with the streaming service at the time for $100 million. “Quibi had a huge offer out to Meghan Markle that was in the tens of millions,” a source said. “Netflix swooped in and their production deal is worth over 100 million.”</p><p>The partnership will work with Meghan and Harry’s production company to create documentaries, children’s programming, docuseries and scripted series. The deal will feature projects that Meghan and Harry care about and highlight issues that are relevant to their nonprofit, Archewell. “Our lives, both independent of each other, and as a couple have allowed us to understand the power of the human spirit: of courage, resilience, and the need for connection,” the couple said in a statement at the time. “Through our work with diverse communities and their environments, to shining a light on people and causes around the world, our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope. As new parents, making inspirational family programming is also important to us, as is powerful storytelling through a truthful and relatable lens. We are pleased to work with Ted [Sarandos] and the team at Netflix whose unprecedented reach will help us share impactful content that unlocks action.”</p><p>Along with their 2022 docuseries, Harry & Meghan, the couple’s Netflix deal also includes Heart of Invictus, another docuseries that follows stories of competitors on their journey to the Invictus Games The Hague 2020, which was held in 2022. Also included in their Netflix deal is Pearl, an animated series following the heroic adventures of a 12-year-old girl who is inspired by influential women throughout history.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a> also reported that Harry and Meghan signed a deal with Harry Walker Agency in June 2020 for speaking engagements, with fees estimated at $1 million per speech. Topics for Harry included mental health and grieving. (Harry Walker also represents the Obamas.) In 2021, Harry and Meghan also launched a podcast with Spotify. Since they left the royals, Meghan and Harry have also worked with streaming services like AppleTV+ and Disney Plus.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six </a>also reported in 2021 that Harry was paid an advance of $20 million from Penguin Random House for his 2023 memoir, <i>Spare</i>. His ghostwriter J.R. Moehringer, also received $1 million in advance, according to Page Six. (Penguin Random House also paid former President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama $65 million for a two-book deal that consisted of Barack’s 2020 memoir, <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i>A Promised Land</i></span></a>, and Michelle’s 2022 memoir, <i>The </i><a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i>Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times</i></span></a>.)</span></p><p>“All of us at Penguin Random House are thrilled to publish Prince Harry’s literary memoir and have him join the world-renowned leaders, icons, and change-makers we have been privileged to publish over the years,” Penguin Random House CEO Markus Dohle said at the time. “Prince Harry has harnessed his extraordinary life experience as a prince, a soldier, and a knowledgeable advocate for social issues, establishing himself as a global leader recognized for his courage and openness. It is for that reason we’re excited to publish his honest and moving story.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Penguin Random House also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Post</a> at the time that Harry plans to donate proceeds from his memoir to charity. “[He will] support British charities with donations from his proceeds from Spare,” the representative said. “The Duke of Sussex has donated $1,500,000 to Sentebale, an organization he founded with Prince Seeiso in their mothers’ legacies, which supports vulnerable children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by HIV/AIDS.”</p><p>The representative added that Harry’s donations from Spare include $347,000 to the non-profit organization WellChild. “WellChild, which he has been Royal patron of for fifteen years, makes it possible for children and young people with complex health needs to be cared for at home instead of hospital, wherever possible,” the spokesperson said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Spare-by-Prince-Harry.jpeg><p class=p1><span class=s1>For more about Prince Harry, read his upcoming memoir, <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i>Spare</i></span></a>.
