Taylor’s brother’s full name is Richard Worthington Green, however, he went by the nickname “Worth.” “Richard Worthington Green, ‘Worth’ as he was known to everyone, age 36, woke up in the arms of Jesus on Thursday, June 8, 2023,” Worth’s <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.westmorelandfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Richard-Worthington-Green?obId=28135525#:~:text=Richard%20Worthington%20Green%2C%20%E2%80%9CWorth%E2%80%9D,Rick%E2%80%9D%20and%20Leslie%20Dark%20Green." rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">obituary</a> read.” Worth was born in Asheville, NC and was the oldest child of Richard C. “Rick” and Leslie Dark Green. He was also the older brother of Catie Green King and her husband, Jim, of Warm Springs, VA and Taylor Ann Green of Charleston, SC.”</p><p>According to his obituary, Worth graduaed from Sunhawk Academy in 2005 and East Carolina University in 2009. He lived for a time in South Korea, where he taught English. “Worth was a 2005 graduate of Sunhawk Academy (“Bad Boy Camp” as he liked to call it) and a 2009 graduate of East Carolina University,” his obituary read. “He was a beautiful example of how to live life as fully as possible. His personality was vibrant, outgoing, and loving. Worth never knew a stranger. He had a love for travel which began when he moved to South Korea after college where he taught English as a second language. One of his favorite trips was playing his newfound passion of golf in Ireland with friends.”</p><p>His obiturary continued, “Worth was no doubt an adventurer. He loved spending time at Lake James and spent many family and friend gatherings there making beautiful memories. Worth had recently started a small men’s group in Raleigh to reflect on life and challenge each other’s faith in Christ. There is no doubt Worth is now in deep, meaningful conversations with Jesus about any and everything.”</p><p>Worth is survived by his parents, Rick and Leslie; his sisters, Taylor and Catie King; his partner Caroline Evans, as well as other family members. “Worth loved his family dearly,” his obituary read. “Any excuse to be with them, he truly loved with his whole heart. He was a vivacious and loving son and grandson, and the best big brother to his sisters, always being there as a protector and a cheerleader. Most recently he met the woman he adored and treasured. Caroline brought so much joy to his life. He loved her enough to bring her home to his family and was beginning to plan a future with her by his side. Friends too numerous to name will miss the exuberant love for life that Worth brought to them.”</p><p>The obiturary continued, “In addition to his parents, Rick & Leslie, and his sisters, Catie Green King (Jim) and Taylor Ann Green, and Caroline Evans of Raleigh, he is survived by his paternal grandmother, Catherine Sellars Green of Burlington; his maternal grandparents, Ralph Marshall Dark, Jr., and Barbara Worthington Dark of Marion; “adopted” grandmother, Melita Burnette of Candler, NC; uncles and aunts include, Marsh and Karen Dark, and David and Kitty Green; many cousins; and his devoted god-mother, Mishew Smith Edwards of Durham, NC. He was preceded in death by his paternal grandfather, Hubert Baxter Green.”</p><p>Southern Charm airs on Thursdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
