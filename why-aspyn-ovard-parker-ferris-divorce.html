Cove came at 38 so we could have a new baby in 2 weeks 🤓😋,” Ovard captioned an Instagram post at the time. Their second child, a daughter named Lola, was born in 2021.</p><p>For almost a decade, Ovard and Ferris shared their lives and relationship with her two-plus million subscribers on YouTube.

Ovard filed for divorce from Ferris after eight years of marriage on April 1, 2024 in Salt Lake City, Utah, according to documents obtained by <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/influencer-aspyn-ovard-files-for-divorce-from-husband-parker-ferris-8623912>People</a>. Ovard filed for divorce the same day she announced the birth of her and Ferris’ third child on Instagram and TikTok. “sweet baby was ready to be born i guess 👶🏼,” Ovard captioned a video announcing the birth of the baby, who was born early. On the video, she wrote, “but i’m only 34 weeks… she’s not ready. just trust me you’ll be fine.”</p><p>Ovard also shared a TikTok video of Ferris pointing at her baby bump in the hospital bed while lip-syncing the SpongeBob quote, “My friend’s in there.” In the clip, Ferris could be seen wearing her wedding band, though Ovard isn’t wearing hers.</p><p>In another Tiktok video, Ovard explained how she was in “shock” because of how early her child was born. “So I just had a baby. I feel like I’m in shock because she’s super early. My brain is just not processing what’s happening. We came in last night. I think we probably got here at like, I don’t know maybe 11 or 12. The baby was born at 6 a.m. and is in the NICU right now. She’s doing really well, but she’s super early, so she’s going to be there for a minute, so it’s definitely a weird experience to not have my baby on my chest right now,” she said. “I think I’m going to get moved to the mama baby unit soon and then after that, I can go up and be with her. I’m just so confused how I literally just had a baby.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>So why did Aspyn Ovard and Parker Ferris divorce? As of writing, Ovard hasn’t revealed the reason for her and Ferris’ divorce. However, fans speculate that the divorce had been in the works for a while after Ovard changed the name of her family YouTube channel to just her name six months prior to her divorce filing. She explained in a YouTube video at the time that she changed the title of the channel because she doesn’t show her children in her videos anymore and “Parker is always with them,” which is why he isn’t in a lot of her videos either. Fans also noticed around the time that Ferris removed “husband” and “father” from his Instagram biography. Ferris has alos disabled Instagram comments after news of his and Ovard’s divorce.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.reddit.com/r/aspynovardsnark/comments/1buhy8a/at_least_shes_been_selfaware/>Reddit</a> users have also resurfaced a YouTube video with Ovard and Ferris from 2023, in which Ovard explains why she isn’t interest in renewing her vows with Ferris. “I feel like the actual vow renewal, I wouldn’t care to do because people just don’t even keep vows. Like I don’t even remember what I said,” Ovard said in the video, which was titled “a q&a where we probably spill too much tea and also got in a fight.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1ubGpkZMSpxYyaqqmxnmK8t63RnWSpmaKgsrN5xZ6pq6GjYrGqws6rmp5n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-aspyn-ovard-parker-ferris-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-aspyn-ovard-parker-ferris-divorce.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-aspyn-ovard-parker-ferris-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-aspyn-ovard-parker-ferris-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-aspyn-ovard-parker-ferris-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-aspyn-ovard-parker-ferris-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tony-leung-ka-fai-the-lover-movie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tony-leung-ka-fai-the-lover-movie.html></a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marisela-zumbado.html>Who is Marisela Zumbado dating?
