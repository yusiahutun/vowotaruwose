But the sisters have tried to dispel these rumors, including those suggesting a fallout with their mom.</p><p>However, this rumored beef seemed to finally be confirmed after the death of the legendary singer, Naomi Judd in April 2022. Sources <a href=#>reported</a> that the crooner left her two daughters out of her will following her passing, choosing instead to appoint her husband, Larry Strickland, as the executor of her estate.</p><p>By implication, Strickland, her children’s stepfather, would have full authority and discretion over her assets, without the need for legal approval.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AshleyWynonna-and-Naomi-Judd.jpeg><p>In his absence, Naomi’s brother-in-law, Reginald Strickland and the president of Tennessee law firm Wiatr & Associates would serve as co-executors. Insiders revealed this decision left Wynonna upset with her late mother and former bandmate.</p><p>According to them, the Country music Hall of Fame inductee deemed herself a major force behind her mom’s success. Claims that Wynonna Judd planned on contesting her mom’s will has also surfaced.</p><p>These claims accuse the Judd sisters of fighting over it, adding to the list of fallouts over the years. But do these rumors have a basis? What is the true state of Naomi Judd’s kids, Ashley Judd and Wynonna Judd’s relationship?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_The_Children_Of_Naomi_Judd_Ashley_Judd_And_Wynonna_Judd></span><strong>Who Are The Children Of Naomi Judd, Ashley Judd And Wynonna Judd?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Naomi Judd’s children, Wynonna Judd and Ashley Judd are famous entertainers in their own right. The late singer’s first daughter, Wynonna, born in 1964 to her ex-boyfriend Charles Jordan, grew up to become a country singer, like her famous mom.</p><p>In the 80s, Naomi and Wynonna formed the band, called The Judds, leading to their signing with RCA Records. Throughout their career as The Judds, they jointly won five Grammy Awards and released six studio albums.</p><p>Aside from her singling ventures, Wynonna also took up acting, with stints in TV shows like “Touched by an Angel.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Ashley Judd joined the family in 1968, born to Naomi and her first husband Michael Ciminella. Like her mom and half-sister, she found fame in the entertainment world, but as an actress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Ashley_And_Wynonna_Judd_Feuding></span><strong>Are Ashley And Wynonna Judd Feuding?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following their mom’s death, rumors of a feud between the sisters made the rounds. However, Wynonna was quick to dispel the rumors.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>While gracing the cover story of People magazine in October 2022, the songstress addressed the rumored beef with her sister regarding the will, <a href=#>saying</a>:</p><p><strong>“Someone told me while I was at Ashley’s house, ‘Hey, did you know that they’re saying this about you?’ I went, ‘Huh? I’m fighting with Ashley? Oh. Again?’ Fighting over what/ I have such a great life. Ashley has a great life. Why would we be fighting over the will?”</strong></p><p>The 58-year-old also addressed the content of the will, and her mom’s decision to make Stricklant the executor of her estate. According to Wynonna, her mom decided to appoint her husband of 33 years as the executor, but when he dies, she and Asley could split the estate, and she had no plans of contesting it. She <a href=#>stressed</a>:</p><p><strong>“I’m the last person in this family – and if Ashley was here, I’d hope she’d agree with me – who knows stuff like this? I’m not savvy enough to go, ‘I’m going to contest the will.’ It never occurred to me.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ashley_Judd_And_Wynonna_Judd_Became_Closer_After_Naomi_Judd_Died></span><strong>Ashley Judd And Wynonna Judd Became Closer After Naomi Judd Died</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Contrary to people’s belief, the children of Naomi Judd maintain they had no beef between them. Although they’ve had many fallouts in the relationship over the years, their mom’s death only made them more united than ever.</p><p>In one interview, Wynonna admitted that their grief over Naomi Judd’s death by suicide has brought her and Ashley closer together. So far, they’ve leaned on each other for support through their difficult times. She <a href=#>explained</a>:</p><p><strong>“We both kind of look at each other like, ‘I’ve got you right?’ And we look at each other and we say, ‘Yeah.’ We’re so united right now. I think more so than we have been in a long time.”</strong></p><p>As further proof of their bond, the sisters united on stage during Wynonna’s second show in Toledo, Ohio on October 1 as part of “The Judds Final Tour.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ashley-Judd-Has-Shared-The-Stage-Singing-With-The-Judds-More-Than-Once-1024x683.png><p>During the show, the singer <a href=#>invited</a> her sister on stage, where the two clarified the prevailing feuding rumors for good. They reiterated just how much they loved each other and how they struggled together with their mom growing up.</p><p>They also reminisced on some of their shared <a href=#>memories with their mom</a>, letting the world know they were family, before anything else.</p><p>It seems their debacles over the years were simply normal family misunderstandings blown up by the media. Underneath the glitz and glam of showbiz, these two remain sisters, in every sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Naomi Judd Ashley Judd wynonna judd</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jJqpnmWelryutYyjrJ2co2KwqbXLnamepl2WwKm4xLJko62UmXq4xc2opaeZXZ%2FCpbCMn5yunF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-naomi-judds-children-ashley-judd-wynonna-judd-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-naomi-judds-children-ashley-judd-wynonna-judd-feud.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-naomi-judds-children-ashley-judd-wynonna-judd-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-naomi-judds-children-ashley-judd-wynonna-judd-feud.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-naomi-judds-children-ashley-judd-wynonna-judd-feud.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-naomi-judds-children-ashley-judd-wynonna-judd-feud.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-jeongbang-waterfall.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-jeongbang-waterfall.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Jeongbang Waterfall</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./video-stripper-falls-20-feet-pole-suffers-broken-jaw-html.html>Video: Stripper falls 20 feet off a pole and suffers a broken jaw</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./video-stripper-falls-20-feet-pole-suffers-broken-jaw-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
