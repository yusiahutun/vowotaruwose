It is a disease of the nervous system that paralyses the body</p><p>‘She has made the most remarkable recovery. It really is a miracle.’</p><p>Grace was struck down with the rare disorder in November last year.&nbsp; She started suffering from tingling in her toes and went to see the GP who could find nothing wrong.</p><p>Then a few days later she had difficulty walking so her mother rushed her to the Medway Mariime Hospital in Kent.</p><p>Miss Etherington, who lives with partner Sean Quinn, 45,&nbsp; a police officer, said: ‘I was so worried about her. She had told me she couldn’t grip a pencil at school and she was having real difficulty walking. She could only move with short stiff steps.’</p><p>Doctors started to run tests and she was kept in hospital overnight, but the following morning Grace couldn’t feel or move her legs. The side of her face went numb too, and she began to slur her words.<br></p><p>Miss Etherington, who also has a 14-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter said: ‘It was really frightening. She was deteriorating infront of my eyes. She’d always been such an active girl, who loved her dancing. But now here she was, lying in hospital and she couldn’t even move her legs.’<br></p><p>Then Grace started choking as the disorder started to paralyse her respiratory system. She was put on a ventilator and rushed to the Evelina Children’s Hospital in London.</p><p>She was diagnosed with Guillan Barre syndrome, a rare disease of the nervous system that paralyses the body. The doctors told Miss Etherington that her daughter’s case was so severe that if she pulled through, she may only be able to blink her eyes for the rest of her life.</p><p>Miss Etherington said: 'I was absolutely devastated. I couldn’t imagine my little girl only being able to blink her eyes for the rest of her life. It was a fate worse than death. She would be trapped in a lifeless shell.’</p><p>Grace remained in a coma for two days and some of her organs started to shut down. Her lung had also collapsed.</p><p>Miss Etherington said: ‘I kept saying to her over and over again that I loved her. And then she began blinking back. So I knew she was saying that she loved me too. It was very emotional.</p><p>But then five days later she started to turn a corner. After ten days she started to move her fingers, and her mouth.</p><p>Miss Etherington said: ‘It was amazing to see. She slowly began to wiggle her fingers and then she started to try and speak. The words didn’t come out at first, but at least she was able to move her mouth.'</p><p>Grace remained on the intensive care unit for six weeks and doctors had to lift her on a sling.</p><p>Slowly the feeling came back in her arms and her legs too and after intensive physiotherapy she managed to take her first steps in December, nearly two months after she had arrived at hospital.</p><p>She carried on learning to walk again at home and in March she was finally able to walk properly again.</p><p>Miss Etherington said: ‘We just couldn’t believe it when she started to walk again. It was like a dream come true.’</p><p>Grace was determined to try and start dancing again. Her dance troupe were due to perform in Londons West End in May, so as soon as she started to walk, she was determined to dance again. She managed to perform with the troupe at the show.</p><p>Miss Etherington said: ‘She wasn’t 100 per cent right on her feet, but she did wonderfully well and we are all very proud of her. When she was lying in the hospital for all those weeks paralysed, it was something I never thought I would see.</p><p>‘She is so determined, and that is what helped her recover so well.<br></p><p>The doctors can’t believe that she has made such a good recovery.</p><p>‘She still suffers from tiredness, but its a small price to pay for her getting better.’</p><p>Grace added: ‘I wanted to tell mum I loved her and I could only do it by blinking. Being stuck in my body was horrible. My mum was there all the time. She saved me.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2BdH6WbW5wZ32ev6Kvy55kq52TpMOmvthmq56dnpa0pnnGoqmlZaCWv6K42KycnWWVlr%2B0ec%2BinKublZl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmiracle-recovery-teenage-girl-paralysed-ears-pierced-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmiracle-recovery-teenage-girl-paralysed-ears-pierced-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmiracle-recovery-teenage-girl-paralysed-ears-pierced-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmiracle-recovery-teenage-girl-paralysed-ears-pierced-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmiracle-recovery-teenage-girl-paralysed-ears-pierced-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmiracle-recovery-teenage-girl-paralysed-ears-pierced-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./review-sza-quicksand-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./review-sza-quicksand-html.html>The Perfectly Off-Center Sound of SZAs New Song, Quicksand</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-high-frequency-wands-for-skin.html>The Best High Frequency Skincare Wands in 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-high-frequency-wands-for-skin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
