And I had Ronald de Boer, who is a friend of mine too, who came last year.</p><p>"But I've not really tapped into my contacts. I just want people to come because they want to come, rather than seeing big-name superstars and all that kind of stuff.</p><p>"Ronald is a friend of mine, and he was in Montenegro so he popped down to see me. And with Gary, he saw pictures on the website when I was down at Charlton for an event, so he came with his wife.</p><p>"It's one of those places that if you were a superstar, nobody will see you. So you get that intimacy that you wouldn't necessarily get anywhere else."</p><p>Ilic admitted that although he might have a tipple too many with guests every now and again, he's really living a much healthier and happier life now.</p><p>"It's a beautiful lifestyle, we eat fresh food practically every day.

It's one of those things that's organised where you get to play with players you used to play against.</p><p>"So, any scuffle you may have had during your playing days with that player, you tend to talk it over and laugh about it later on.</p><p>"It's a fantastic way to travel, meet players and it's also good for the ego.
