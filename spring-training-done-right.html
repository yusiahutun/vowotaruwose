Some don’t allow bags at all, while others have precise size requirements or require items such as backpacks to be clear. If you don’t comply with their policy, you won’t be able to take your bag inside and will likely have to rent a storage locker, so check the park’s website before heading to the game.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Courtesy-Roger-Dean-Chevrolet-Stadium-1024x829.jpg><h2>On the Roster</h2><p class=p1><i>There is a method to the madness when it comes to which players you’ll see during a training game</i></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>•</span> <b>If you hope to see some superstar players in action, be sure to get to the game on time.</b> Start<span class=s2>ers typically play only the first few innings, while players whose status on the roster is still undecided take the field in later innings.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>•</span> <b>As it gets closer to regular season, teams start narrowing down their rosters.</b> If you want to see more developing, under-the-radar players, attend games earlier in the season. If you would rather get a feel for what the team will actually look like during regular season, attend the later games.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>•</span> <b>Always grab a program on your way into the stadium.</b> It will provide you with the names and jersey numbers of new, up-and-coming players and non-roster invitees you may not recognize.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/The-Cassidy-Cool-Zone-at-Roger-Dean.-Courtesy-Roger-Dean-Chevrolet-Stadium-1024x713.jpg><h2>Location, Location!</h2><p class=p1><i>Where to sit for the best possible experience</i></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>First things first: If you are cheering for a particular team, you want to be on the right side of the action.</b></span> Be sure to look at the stadium’s seating chart and make sure you buy tickets in your team’s section. At Clover Park, the Mets dugout is always on the third base side. At Roger Dean and The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, designated team dugouts are: Cardinals and Nationals on the first base line, Marlins and Astros on the third base line. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>All three stadiums have varying levels of seating ranging from grass seats to VIP suites.</b></span> If the more the merrier is how you roll, consider The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches’ Party Decks (for 50-90 people). Roger Dean has the Cassidy Cool Zone (for parties of 30 or more), which is located under a covered party deck along right field and includes a two-hour all-you-can-eat buffet. The stadium’s Chido Beach (for groups of 16 or more) features four-top tables and drink rail seating behind the Cardinals bullpen with a rotating all-you-can-eat menu. Clover Park offers numerous suites, including the Sky Suite at Press Level with A/C, TV, and a catering attendant for up to 20 people. There are also two party decks: the Budweiser Party Terrace on field level next to the Mets bullpen and a First Base Party Deck on the Suite Level.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Don’t forget the sun!</b></span> With many of the games in the middle of the day, the sun can be as annoying as your rival team. Roger Dean is Florida’s only spring training stadium without a roof, so try getting seats underneath the overhang from the press box to minimize the rays. The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches offers a good amount of shade, with the most all-game shade in sections 110-116. At Clover Park, the odd-<span class=s2>numbered sections are shaded when the game starts; </span>even-numbered seats are usually in full shade by 2:15 p.m.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Signing-baseball-stock-image-1024x683.jpg alt="Boy getting an autograph on his baseballSome other related images:" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Sign Here, Please</h2><p class=p1><i>Want to score an autograph from your favorite player? Here’s how.</i></p><p class=p1><b>Get creative. </b>Come prepared with a Sharpie and bring a unique item for a player to sign. The more creative the item is, the more players will notice you.</p><p class=p1><b>Pick the right target.</b> Identify up-and-comers beforehand and learn their names. These younger players, especially when called by name, are typically more receptive to autograph requests.</p><p class=p1><b>And the right day.</b> Weekday games are typically less crowded, thus have more potential for signature success.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Get in position.</b> At Roger Dean, the bullpens are where the action is. The Marlins dugout by left field is said to be one of the most player-accessible spots at any spring training ballpark. In general, the practice fields are a great opportunity to snag autographs—the players are more relaxed, and there are fewer fans to compete with.</span></p><p class=p1><b>Beat the crowds.</b> Workouts occur on both game days and in the weeks leading up to opening day. At Clover Park and The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, they’re open to the public and can be a great time to get up close and personal with players and potentially snag a signature as they leave practice.</p><h2>Batter Up!</h2><p class=p1>Did you know you can also attend players’ batting practice? Roger Dean allows fans to watch the pre-game swing action for a $5 charge. Gates typically open for batting practice one hour before general gates open. At The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches and Clover Park, batting practice is included with your game ticket. Check each park’s website for specific start times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Signing-baseball-stock-image-1024x683.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Mr.-Met-mascot-for-the-New-York-Mets-231x300.jpg><h2>Mascot Mania</h2><p class=p1><i>Be on the lookout for appearances by these crowd-amping creatures</i></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>NY Mets:</b></span><b> </b><i>Mr. Met,</i> a character with a large baseball head</p><p class=p1><span class=s3><b>Washington Nationals:</b></span><b> </b><i>Screech,</i> a bald eagle<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s2><b>Miami Marlins:</b></span> <i>Billy the Marlin,</i> an 8-foot-tall marlin</p><p class=p1><span class=s5><b>St. Louis Cardinals:</b></span> <i>Fredbird,</i> a cardinal</p><p class=p1><span class=s6><b>Houston Astros:</b></span> <i>Orbit, </i>a baseball-loving alien<span class=s4><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><h2>Players to Watch</h2><p class=p1><i>Keep your eye on these prospects who will be battling for a spot on their team’s MLB opening day roster</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Screech-mascot-for-the-Washington-Nationals-231x300.jpg><p class=p1><b>Cardinals: Jordan Walker</b></p><p class=p2>A first-round draft pick in 2020, Walker excelled in Class AA and posted a .925 OPS and a .558 slugging percentage in the elite Arizona Fall League, making him not only the Cardinals’ top prospect but also a top prospect in all of the minors.

While managing the Brooklyn Dodgers, Robinson’s starting catcher, Casey Stengel, decided to call him out on his boastful nature by wagering that he couldn’t catch a baseball dropped from an airplane. Robinson accepted the bet, and Stengel took off with famed pilot Ruth Law, who was in town for an air show. What Stengel didn’t share, however, was that he planned to pull a prank and replace the baseball with a grapefruit. When the grapefruit landed, it covered Robinson with juice and pulp—and actually knocked him out for a spell. Stengel quipped that Robinson “just couldn’t cut it in the Grapefruit League,” and the rest is history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLvUrZuop6KofLS80aKloGWkp66qusinnmacn6Oybr7IoJ%2BtZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fspring-training-done-right.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fspring-training-done-right.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fspring-training-done-right.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fspring-training-done-right.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fspring-training-done-right.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fspring-training-done-right.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./andre-agassi-photo-wife-steffi-graf-skateboard-youthful.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./andre-agassi-photo-wife-steffi-graf-skateboard-youthful.html>Andre Agassi shares photo of age-defying wife Steffi Graf, 54, in rare insight into enduring love</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./live-nation-plans-gospel-tour-with-the-kings-men.html>Live Nation Plans Gospel Tour With The King's Men</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./live-nation-plans-gospel-tour-with-the-kings-men.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
