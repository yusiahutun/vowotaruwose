He drowned in his hot tub at his Los Angeles home with first responders being called to his residence around 4 pm that day. There were no drugs found with the <a href=#>TV</a> star, but his cause of death has been revealed as “the acute effects of ketamine” by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office. This was not the only factor in the actor’s death as they also included “drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine.” (Buprenorphine is used to treat an addiction to narcotics). His death has been ruled an accident.</p><p>Since the tragic news, it’s said the presence of ketamine was as a result of therapy, and not recreational use.</p><p>Matthew was known for playing the much-loved and sarcastic character of Chandler Bing on the 90s and 2000s sitcom <a href=#>Friends</a>, which ran for 10 seasons between 1994 and 2004. The Friends cast <a href=#>paid tribute to their co-star individually</a> in the days and weeks following his death, but a collective statement was released just a couple of days after his passing.</p><p>The other five ‘Friends,’ Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family. There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>“In time we will say more, as and when we are able,” the statement continues. “For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michael-gambon>Michael Gambon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-623046266-815x1024.jpg><p><a href=#>Sir Michael Gambon</a> passed away at the age of 82. The celebrity’s family announced the film actor’s death had occurred on September 27. He had suffered “a bout of pneumonia” which led to his death.</p><p>His family said they were “devastated” at his loss: “We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside, following a bout of pneumonia. We ask that you respect our privacy at this painful time and thank you for your messages of support and love.”</p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star had a long career of nearly five decades in both TV and film with an impressive list of projects to his name but is perhaps remembered best by younger audiences for his portrayal as Albus Dumbledore in the <a href=#>Harry Potter</a> franchise. He took over the role in 2004’s Prisoner of Azkaban from Richard Harris, who died in 2002 after playing the Hogwarts headmaster in the first two installments.</p><p>Daniel Radcliffe, who played the title role in all eight films, called his co-star “silly, irreverent, and hilarious.”</p><p>“With the loss of&nbsp;Michael Gambon&nbsp;the world just became considerably less fun. Michael Gambon was one of the most brilliant, effortless actors I’ve ever had the privilege of working with, but despite his immense talent, the thing I will remember most about him is how much fun he had doing his job,” Daniel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paul-rubens>Paul Rubens</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-517509126-796x1024.jpg><p>Actor and comedian Paul Rubens died on July 30 at the age of 70. The celebrity’s cause of death earlier in 2023 was initially listed as acute hypoxic respiratory failure, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to</a> People. This means not enough oxygen was released into the blood.</p><p>However, it was later revealed the star had two types of cancer at the time of his death. Paul had acute myelogenous leukemia, which is “a cancer of the blood and bone marrow – the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.” He also had metastatic lung cancer. This type of cancer comes from cancerous tumors that start somewhere else in the body and spread to the lungs. He had been suffering from these diagnoses for “six years.”</p><p>In a statement released after he had left us, Paul apologized to fans. “Please accept my apology for not going public with what I’ve been facing the last six years. I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you,” said the comedian.</p><p>Paul was best known for his hugely popular 80s character Pee-wee Herman, who had two blockbuster films called Pee-wee’s Big Adventure&nbsp;and Big Top Pee-wee, which were released in 1985 and 1988 respectively.</p><p>Director Tim Burton, who directed the first Pee-wee film, posted to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> upon Paul’s death and said he was “shocked and saddened.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>‘Godfather of avocado toast’ Bill Granger dies after cancer battle</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-steve-harwell>Steve Harwell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-30-at-11.31.49-e1703937460551-1024x666.png><p>Steve Harwell, who was the <a href=#>lead singer of the rock band</a> Smash Mouth between 1994 and 2021, died at the age of 56 on September 4 while at home in Boise, Idaho. The celebrity’s death in September 2023 came after he suffered for many years from alcohol abuse and other health issues that affected his motor skills, speech, and memory. Smash Mouth’s manager Robert Hayes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> Steve’s death to be from acute liver failure.</p><p>During the rock star’s tenure with the group, they released two of their biggest hits: All Star and a cover of The Monkees’ track I’m a Believer. All Star was Grammy-nominated at the 2000 ceremony though it didn’t win. However, After his 2023 death, the celebrity’s and his band’s legacy will forever be marked by Dreamwork’s beloved 2001 classic, Shrek. All Star is used in the opening scene of the film while their version of I’m a Believer can be heard at the end of the film. Originally, All Star was meant to be a “placeholder” with other music being used later in production, <a href=# rel=nofollow>but the song was kept in</a> and is now a fan-favorite part of the movie.</p><p>Before he died, Steve Harwell was in a <a href=#>hospice with his illnesses</a> for end-of-life care. When he retired two years ago, he <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “Ever since I was a kid, I dreamed of being a Rockstar performing in front of sold-out arenas and have been so fortunate to live out that dream. To my bandmates, it’s been an honor performing with you all these years and I can’t think of anyone else I would have rather gone on this wild journey with.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-suzanne-sommers>Suzanne Sommers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1207426158-1024x683.jpg><p><a href=#>Suzanne Sommers</a> was an established actress who succumbed to “an aggressive form” of breast cancer just a day before her 77th birthday on October 15.

Suzanne will be remembered for the feminist move she made during her time in Three’s Company when she demanded a salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 per episode so her pay was on par with her male co-star John Ritter. However, her asking for more ended her time on the series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sinead-o-connor>Sinead O’Connor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-30-at-11.34.47-e1703937800409-1024x746.png><p>Music icon <a href=#>Sinead O’Connor</a> passed away at the age of 56 on July 26.
