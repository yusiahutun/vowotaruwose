We both have roots in Canada and entered the beauty industry in 2011.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A decade ago, at my first magazine gig in Toronto, editors wouldn't stop gushing over this new Canadian brand's matte lipsticks and the fact that you could make your own personalized shade at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Bite's Lip Lab</a>. And when I finally swiped Fig, a soft pink, on my lips for the first time, I immediately got the hype.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The brand's Amuse Bouche Matte Lipstick quickly gained a cult following internationally after Sephora started carrying it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an unexpected plot twist, Bite Beauty, a brand whose lipsticks put them on the map, discontinued its beloved Amuse Bouche Matte Lipstick in 2019. Diehard fans of the creamy, pigmented formula were so distraught, they frantically bought their favorite shades in bulk when they were marked down at Sephora.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, after a brief hiatus, Bite is relaunching its beloved matte lipstick with a revamped formula and a new name: the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Power Move Soft Matte Lipstick</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Almost three years in the making, Power Move offers the same quality pigment and comfortable wear as the original, but the new formula has a softer matte finish and is cruelty-free and vegan — meaning it doesn't contain any animal byproducts such as carmine, beeswax, or lanolin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We loved Amuse Bouche just as much as our fans did — and in developing a brand new, vegan lipstick collection, we definitely listened to what they had to say," Sarah Koch, SVP/GM of Bite Beauty exclusively tells InStyle. "First, many of our Bite fans wondered why we were clean but not vegan, and we felt that it was time to eliminate all non-vegan ingredients from our entire product line."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Koch says Power Move is more lightweight than Amuse Bouche, which was a thicker, more traditional lipstick formula. "With Power Move, we've created a lightweight lipstick that feels comfortable on lips all day, without compromising wear or comfort," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Priced at $28 each, there are 20 shades to choose from, ranging from nudes to rich berries. And a few of the colors will be familiar to fans of Amuse Bouche. The matte charcoal tube is making its return, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We took into account the cult-favorite Amuse Bouche shades — and brought six of the top shades like Chai, Fig, and Cayenne back," Koch says. "It was also a top priority to make sure the shade range would look great on everyone — and that multiple shades in each shade bucket would work for an individual."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy: </strong>$28 each; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sephora.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The lipstick gets its creamy, velvety texture from nourishing cocoa butter, blurring tapioca pearls and a blend of fatty acids. And Bite promises feather-free and fade-resistant color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As of now, Power Move is a formula that isn't available in Bite's Lip Labs, where you can make your own custom shade of lipstick. "Power Move is an entirely new formula and finish that isn't yet available in our Lip Labs," Koch adds. "Lip Lab offers a texture more similar to the original Amuse Bouche, that comes in four different finishes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, eight InStyle editors, all with different lipstick shade and formula preferences put Bite Beauty's new Power Move Soft Matte Lipstick to the test.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Jenna Brillhart, Senior Digital Art Director, in Maple</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Coming out of quarantine, I haven't been wearing a lot of makeup because of how heavy it can feel on my face. This formula is great because it's lightweight and doesn't feel like I'm putting a lot on my lips. I really love the shade Maple because I can apply it with my fingers for a bitten look during the day, and then re-apply for a bolder look at night. It also doesn't really budge during my morning coffee, so I don't find myself reapplying as much as I do with other lipsticks. I'm definitely going to be carrying this around in my bag this summer!"</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Erin Lukas, Beauty Editor, in Beetroot</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In the 'before times,' I typically chose bright eyeshadow or eyeliner over a lipstick every time. However, now that I'm only wearing a mask part-time, I find myself becoming more and more of a lipstick person. And that's exactly why Beetroot, a rich berry shade, caught my eye. The formula glides on lips like butter on toast and offers impressive color payoff in one coat. Despite being a bold color, it's easy to wear. While I had a little bit of transfer on my glass and mask, the matte formula slightly faded into an effortless-looking stain."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Isabel Jones, Associate News Writer, in Extra Sugar Buns</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I typically prefer a tinted lip balm or liquid lipstick to the classic formula, but one of the first things I noticed when I applied this Bite shade was how hydrating it was. Unfortunately, my lips did get a little dry throughout the evening, but I really put this lipstick through the wringer — masks, drinks, food, humidity, all of it. The warm, deep hue feels subtle enough for any occasion, but rich enough to add a formality to any look. And after over a year in quarantine, my lips are more than ready to dress up [insert dancing lady emoji here]."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Kayla Greaves, Senior Beauty Editor, in Ginger Malt</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What I love most about Ginger Malt is that it's just such a gorgeous reddish-brown shade — it really reminds me of the colors that were popular in the '90s. On top of that, even though it gives you a matte, lip-stain-like finish, it goes on silky smooth and the formula is non-drying. It also offers buildable color, so you can keep the shade pretty sheer or go for a more bold look. I'll definitely be wearing this to my next patio dinner or outdoor day party."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Erin Glover, Associate Photo Editor, in Fig</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love how light this feels! I'm not usually a makeup person but this feels like I'm wearing nothing at all. It didn't stick to my glass or bleed into my face, which was a bonus for the date night."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Samantha Sutton, Senior Fashion Editor, in Cayenne</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I pretty much only wear bright, in-your-face lipstick colors, so when looking at this collection, Cayenne immediately caught my eye. I'm a sucker for vibrant reds with a little bit of orange, and this one definitely fit the bill — although I will say it was slightly darker than expected when I uncapped it, and it didn't seem too different from Hot Tomato, another shade I tried. After snapping a few selfies, I went about my day, but was constantly surprised whenever I caught my reflection in the mirror, since my lipstick stayed put for hours after a single application, but at the same time, was undetectable. I think I've found my new go-to!"</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Omenaa Boakye, Contributing Beauty Writer, in Maple</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This lipstick is a shade of red that I feel I can wear every day — I love it! Whenever I usually wear red lipstick, I find myself having to apply a dark burgundy lip liner on top so my lips don't look too bright. I don't feel like I have to apply anything to this Maple shade, it looks great on it's own."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Kelly Chiello, Visuals Editor, in Juniper</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am really impressed with this lipstick! I normally avoid lipstick because it tends to be too shiny or too sticky, but that is not the case with tube. The matte texture stays pretty firmly on my lips and dries instantly. And only a very small amount rubbed off on my mask when I went out. Juniper is vibrant and fun for summer, and I think I may have to trade my colorful eyeliners for lipsticks now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bite Beauty's Power Move Soft Matte Lipstick is available for $28 at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">bitebeauty.com</a>, sephora.com, and in-store at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sephora</a> on July 22, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2iamamybq7EmqytsV2lvLix0WakqK6VYrqiwNOeZKWhoKjBqq%2FKZqmerpmaxG64wK6lnKA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbite-beauty-power-move-matte-lipstick-review-launch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbite-beauty-power-move-matte-lipstick-review-launch.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbite-beauty-power-move-matte-lipstick-review-launch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbite-beauty-power-move-matte-lipstick-review-launch.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbite-beauty-power-move-matte-lipstick-review-launch.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbite-beauty-power-move-matte-lipstick-review-launch.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./briony-turner-and-ed-howard-named-co-presidents-of-atlantic-records-uk.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./briony-turner-and-ed-howard-named-co-presidents-of-atlantic-records-uk.html>Briony Turner And Ed Howard Named Co-Presidents Of Atlantic Records UK</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fun-telegram-game-bots-to-try.html>8 Fun Telegram Game Bots You Should Try</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fun-telegram-game-bots-to-try.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
