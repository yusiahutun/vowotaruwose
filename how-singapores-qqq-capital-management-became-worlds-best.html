While those stocks had soared this year, they’ve been hit with concerns about regulatory crackdowns and allegations of accounting fraud, and one has plunged in recent weeks amid downgrades from analysts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/05/c2bda734-1f01-11eb-99d6-deeedd63f648_1320x770_092746.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When we invest, we know everything about an industry, its top five people, their personality, their weakness, their greatness, everything about them,” Qian said in an interview.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Qian’s experience with the Chinese education system runs deep. Born in 1972 – the same year US President Richard Nixon visited China – Qian grew up amid the rapid economic growth that followed the Cultural Revolution. After graduating from North China University of Technology, he joined a teaching centre, specialising in helping students prepare for universities abroad. Then he took the leap himself, earning an MBA from the Yale School of Management in 2000, where he now sits on its Greater China board of advisers.</p>After returning to China, Qian was coaxed back to the teaching centre and made a co-founder as it expanded. It later became the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">New Oriental Education & Technology Group,</span></a> a giant in the space with a market capitalisation of almost US$26 billion on the New York Stock Exchange.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After leaving New Oriental, he helped build and sell mobile content provider Atop Century and bought a substantial stake in online dating service Jiayuan.com. But as Beijing’s haze got worse and his children developed asthma, he moved to Singapore in 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to start an internet company in Singapore but it wasn’t feasible because you couldn’t find enough talented technology people,” he said. “So the only thing I could do was the financial industry.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After five years running his own account, Qian, 48, turned professional in 2018 – seeding QQQ with US$100 million of his own money. That year the fund returned almost 40 per cent despite only running for three quarters. In 2019 it gained 31 per cent, outpacing the S&P 500 Index both years. The fund was granted an upgraded licence by Singapore in August, removing a S$250 million (US$183 million) asset cap.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/09/11/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:00</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Schools in China make students cover eyes to feel gratitude for parents</p><p>Schools in China make students cover eyes to feel gratitude for parents</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">QQQ trades almost exclusively in US-listed stocks, so Qian gets up at noon and eats before exercising around Singapore’s Botanic Gardens. The rest of the day is spent catching up with friends and family before starting work by 8pm, 90 minutes before the New York market opens. Over the next eight hours he lives online, absorbing news and company reports while trawling social media and trading stocks.</p>Like other hedge funds, his team of six people does plenty of alternative data analysis. They frequently trade <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tesla</span></a> shares, so it checks satellite pictures of car lots and shipping manifests. QQQ also has people attend after-school tutoring classes in China to gauge attendance, and buys calls and puts on the indices to help hedge tail risk. Qian also taps his contacts and former students for their views on the businesses.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Qian says his edge is entrepreneurial experience from running companies, adding that every business QQQ bets on represents thousands of hours of research – giving it the confidence to make massive bets in selected areas. It currently has about 55 per cent of assets in cash, betting that US stimulus negotiations would fail and roil markets. The S&P 500 dropped in four of five sessions last week, hitting a five-week low.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s online education sector could be among biggest beneficiaries of Covid-19</span></p></a></h3>The concentrated calls have paid off so far. Over the past year, New Oriental Education has risen 31 per cent, while GSX Techedu has soared almost fourfold and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">TAL Education Group</span></a> is up 55 per cent.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In large part the superior performance could be attributed to good stock selection in the edu-tech space,” said Eurekahedge head analyst Mohammad Hassan in an email, noting the fund has returned 444 per cent since June 2019. So far this year, the Eurekahedge Long Short Equities Hedge Fund Index is up 4.7 per cent.</p>The bets come with plenty of risks. TAL in April admitted that an employee may have forged sales contracts. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">GSX</span></a> announced last month it was being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Regulators demanded financial records dating to 2017 following reports by short sellers including Muddy Waters. When Credit Suisse Group – one of the banks that took GSX public last year – downgraded the company to sell on October 21, the stock plunged 31 per cent. The recent declines could topple QQQ from the No. 1 spot among hedge funds. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/04/24/thumbnail_-_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:25</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">US colleges face US$15 billion hit as Chinese students stay away amid coronavirus pandemic</p><p>US colleges face US$15 billion hit as Chinese students stay away amid coronavirus pandemic</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Under diversification can go both ways – if you’re right in your investment thesis you could potentially make a lot of money, but if you’re wrong there’s a big downside,” said Melvyn Teo, a finance professor at Singapore Management University. The concentration may also deter blue-chip investors from QQQ’s funds, as they tend to prefer more diversification, Teo added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A QQQ spokesman said there had been a “small drawdown” recently but the fund’s positions were hedged and it was still doing well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Qian declined to comment on claims against the education companies, though he said he trusts many of the key leaders and understands the fundamentals. QQQ is open with clients about the risks, at times declining money from investors that he feels can’t handle the potential losses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I haven’t given my team any targets for fundraising – we’re only two and a half years old and the track record is the most important thing,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beyond that, he’s not afraid to set lofty goals: “we want to be the biggest wealth management firm in the world,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfl66vt8innmaemaOur6%2FEaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpncW1ibnypu9ZmqqKml5a9sL7ErGSqqaFisKK8yK2YpWWdlruis8SmnKesXZeypK3MnmSwp6KhsbR5wZ6qrQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-singapores-qqq-capital-management-became-worlds-best.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-singapores-qqq-capital-management-became-worlds-best.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-singapores-qqq-capital-management-became-worlds-best.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-singapores-qqq-capital-management-became-worlds-best.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-singapores-qqq-capital-management-became-worlds-best.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-singapores-qqq-capital-management-became-worlds-best.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kaiju-no-8-announces-new-manga-spin-off-everything-we-know-so-far-1299765.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kaiju-no-8-announces-new-manga-spin-off-everything-we-know-so-far-1299765.html>Kaiju No. 8 Announces New Manga Spin-Off; Everything We Know So Far</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hollyoaks-cast-jorgie-porter-instagram-16867614.html>Hollyoaks babe Jorgie Porter talks sex symbol status: 'Boys think they're getting FHM'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hollyoaks-cast-jorgie-porter-instagram-16867614.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
