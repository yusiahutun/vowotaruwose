And it all belongs to one – in his own words, “slightly obsessive” – antiquarian, Loewentheil.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A lawyer by training, American-born Loewentheil assembled the collection over decades, with an emphasis on images of the highest artistic and historical quality.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Images of old Hong Kong, as seen through the lens of photographer James Chung</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also collects and sells rare books, and recently bought Shakespeare’s First Folio for nearly US$10 million through a Christie’s live-streamed auction.
