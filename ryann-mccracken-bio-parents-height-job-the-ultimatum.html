Who is she? Where is she from? Who are her parents? What job does she have?</p><p>The answer unfolds below as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>The Ultimatum Season 2: Are Ryann McCracken And James Morris Still Together?</strong></h3><p>While Ryann McCracken and James Morris’s current relationship status is unclear their social media gives a few hints. The couple was last spotted together on <a href=#>Ryann’s TikTok</a> in September 2022. On Ryan’s birthday in 2022, James also wished her, “Happy Birthday to my personal superwoman 😍 24 has never looked so good.” It is likely after the time that the pair started filming the show and keeping all of the details after that as a secret.</p><p>But there are good chances that Ryann and James are still together.</p><p>Ryann and James are evidence that high school sweethearts can remain together after almost seven years. The former prom queen and football player began dating when they were barely 16 years old, so it goes without saying that maturing has not been without its challenges.</p><p>Their communication and trust problems as adults have only gotten worse as James finished school in a different state. After all this time, Ryann feels that James “should know for sure” that she is his permanent partner, therefore she is now offering him the ultimatum. Ryann doesn’t want to waste any more time if it isn’t necessary. James, on the other hand, is determined to build a solid foundation for their married life. He hopes to find a job that is stable enough to start their next chapter on the right foot before they go down the aisle.</p><p>But their quest might come to an end if Ryann doesn’t receive a ring soon.</p><p>As a result, it should come as no surprise that she started to wonder if he ever thought of her as forever. As a result, she gave him the ultimatum after waiting seven long years to get the answers he so desperately needed.</p><p>“I feel like at this point…,” Ryann candidly said in the show, “you should know for sure, am I the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?… Like, if he’s unsure about marrying me, then what am I doing?” On the other hand, James expressed, “I find it hard to believe in a one true love. Statistically, I just don’t think that’s possible. There’s 8 billion people in this world.” Plus, since he’s a recent college graduate, he added he genuinely wants to “make sure we’re in a better financial space” before moving on to the next step of getting engaged and eventually starting a family.</p><p>However, James knew Ryann was the one for him the moment he heard Treyvon “Trey” Brunson praise her for her beauty, kindness, passion, and simplicity during the trial marriage selection. This Research Assistant continued the experiment with Jeriah “Riah” Nyree, but his heart was focused on his long-term love. The very real prospect of losing her had just become obvious. Therefore, he wasn’t the best partner to Riah, but he knew exactly where he went wrong and promised to mend the situation even if her trial run with Trey went well at every turn.</p><p>Once they got back in touch, it was understandable that James took some time, but after a few arguments and him making his jealousy known, he finally opened up to Ryann about every aspect of his experience. It turns out that the main obstacle in their relationship unintentionally resulted from his perception that he was weak and unworthy as a result of his history, which was also a contributing factor in why he used to self-harm. “You are the love of my life, Ryann,” he then asserted. “I love you more than anything in this world. You may have issued me the ultimatum, but I’ve never not known I wanted to marry you. I guess I was always scared.”</p><p>Ahead of the premiere, Ryan posted on her IG, “Giving you an ultimatum to catch me on “The Ultimatum: Marry Or Move On season 2” premiering August 23rd only on Netflix. ⏰👀⏳💍.”</p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The couple celebrated their anniversary on 9 August.</p><p>On their 5th anniversary in 2020, Ryann wrote, “Words cannot express the amount of joy that this young woman has brought into my life. So, since I’m more of a numbers guy, maybe some numbers will. 5 years, 1825 days, 43,800 hours, 2,628,000, that is 157,680,000 (give or take 40,000 or 50,000 at the time of this post) seconds that I’ve been lucky enough to call this young woman mine. Infinity is not just a big number, it’s endless, immeasurable, and unstoppable. I love you Ryann Taylor McCracken and will continue to do so infinitely. I cannot wait to spend this lifetime and an infinite number more with you. ♾ #randj8915.”</p><h3><strong>Ryann McCracken Age</strong></h3><p>Ryann McCracken reached age 24 in 2022.
