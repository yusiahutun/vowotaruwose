That was a third of her life at the time, and for the entirety of her adulthood.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"I was with him through wild times, calm times, and all the times in between up until the day he passed away," she wrote. "That day was very hard. I have lost a lot of people in my life and death is a difficult topic for me.⁣"</p><p>Calling herself an introvert, Crystal said that's why she stayed mostly quiet and "more private over the years." But as the "Girls Next Door" and other Playboy-affiliated women have come forward with their stories, Crystal has begun to open up.</p><p>Crystal became Hefner's "number one girlfriend" and ultimately his wife after things broke off between him and the three original stars of the "Girls" reality show, Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson.

"I will tell you about my life and how my upbringing and years leading up to the Halloween party where I met Hef was the perfect storm that whisked me through those gates."</p><p>Springboarding off of that fateful night, Crystal said that one of her therapists worded her decade behind the gates with a phrase worded with a bit of a sinister tone. "It’s like you went trick or treating at a house and then wasn’t let back out for ten years," she was told, agreeing that the experience was kind of like that.</p><p>"I’m ready to tell my story.

"As a brand with sex positivity at its core, we believe safety, security, and accountability are paramount. The most important thing we can do right now is actively listen and learn from their experiences."</p><p>The statement further noted that more than 80 percent of its current workforce is female, adding that the company "will never be afraid to confront the parts of our legacy as a company that do not reflect our values today."</p><p>"We are committed to our ongoing evolution as a company and to driving positive change for our communities," the statement concluded.</p><p>Crystal said that through her time in the Playboy Mansion, she "longed for freedom from what I found myself in," but instead experienced "the grueling opposite for ten years."
