Lots of families lose their near and dear ones. The report shows that most of the people who died in road accidents are mostly between the ages ranges of 10 to 29 years. Most of the people in road accidents are dying only because they did not get medical support at the right time. But what causes such road accidents? The obvious answer to this question is- Over-speeding, rash driving, violation of rules, failure to understand signs, fatigue, alcohol, high risk-taking attitude, and instant negative response to provocation. But all this behaviour does not take place in one day. Such behaviour has some hidden reasons and practice of some thoughts and actions.</p><p>Each day a new form of problem is taking place in the world. One such problem is road rage. It’s quite a new term which is used these days. Road rage has increased the number of accidents and criminal acts these days. Many factors can be the cause of this behaviour which is taking place nowadays. Let’s talk about Road Rage in detail:</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What is Road Rage?</h4><p>Road rage is aggressive, criminal or violent behaviour of the drive on road which is sometimes because of drivers Psychological factors and sometimes because of other driver’s expressive provoked behaviour. In this behaviour, rude behaviour or verbal insult and abuse, yelling, showing odd gestures, dangerous driving style and targeting the other person on the road is used by the driver or other person for releasing frustration or anger. Basically the suppressed feeling of the driver and another person gets expressed on the road which is intended to hurt or disturb another person.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Forms of Road Rage:</h5><li>Tailgating.</li><li>Yelling.</li><li>Honking in anger.</li><li>Making angry gestures.</li><li>Not allowing or trying to block another vehicle from changing lanes.</li><li>Purposefully cutting off another vehicle.</li><li>Asking the driver to come out of the vehicle or Getting out of the vehicle to confront another driver.</li><li>Bumping another vehicle on purpose.</li><li>Flash their headlights</li><li>Weave recklessly in and out of traffic.</li><li>Speed.</li><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What are the psychological reasons behind the road rage:</h4><h5 class=wp-block-heading>1) Uncontrolled anger:</h5><p>Energy of emotions and words does not end it can only be transformed with repeated efforts. Anger is one such emotion which can affect person or society if not channelized on time. Sometimes person cannot express their emotions and this disturbs their life. Such unprocessed emotions can rule over his/her everyday behaviour and every aspect of their life.</p><p>It’s easier to express unwanted or negative emotions on unknown people than known. While the person is driving or walking on the road he or she expresses these feelings because they easily get triggered when they are full of emotion energy and things do not work according to them. Their behaviour is dependent on emotions rather than conscience.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>2) Distracted Driving:</h5><p>Life is full of challenges and demands and sometimes these challenges and demands occupy a person’s mind even when they are doing tasks which require attention. While driving, it’s common for people to get into thoughts, texting, talking on phone, listening to the radio or music on high pitch, eating and they become less aware about their surroundings. In such situations they unintentionally disturb another person’s driving by hitting or blocking the road. Another person gets offended by this behaviour and the person who was occupied in thoughts does not accept his/her mistakes. For them it is just a simple behaviour of mistake but for another driver it can be a provoking situation. This situation turns into road rage when both the parties are not ready to understand each other.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>3) Speed and Getting late:</h5><p>It is seen that people in young age drive more on urges and emotions and sometimes they forget or overlook danger as they want to experience adventure. Riding a vehicle at high speed increases the chances of road accidents and road age. Now a days it’s important to reach on time and people who miss to do so drive fast to reach the desired place. As such, people are getting late when they meet undesirable situations (like traffic, road construction work) while driving they become irritated and get involved in road rage.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>4) Tendency to react emotionally:</h5><p>Some people get easily triggered then others because they are short-tempered. Such people get easily offensive and get into fight. It not easy for them to think before they act. Even they know that they have to be calm, hold patients and not react so rapidly but them fails to do so. Such people get into road age often because of their behaviour pattern.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>6) Hidden identity:</h5><p>Sometime people behave differently or emotionally when their identity is hidden or difficult to be identified. They think that what a strange can do or can create damage to them. Such feeling they get into behaviour which is hurting or distributing for another person, but they are carefree and fearless because they are sure about their safety and security.</p><p>7) Stress, anxiety and mental health condition-Sometimes anxiety and stress can lead to careless driving. It can also lead to road accidents as driver is unable to focus on road. Due to mental health conditions sometime person gets easily triggers as well. It’s important to understand that when persons does not feel ok, they should not drive and get into trouble.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Psychological theory of road rage:</h4><p>Road rage can be explained by Frustration aggressive model (Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer & Sears, 1939). This theory explains that frustration leads to aggression and gets displayed to the person who is lesser in status or unknown or unrelated to the actual frustration caused.<br>Frustration refers to a state of being or feeling of irritation which a person experiences because of blocking of a desired goal or goal which seems not achievable. A person is initially frustrated and some environmental cues increase the frustration. This anger is displayed to a person to achieve catharsis (feeling or relief).</p><p>In the light of this theory person can understand road rage behaviour very clearly. As the person who is driving is inwardly prone to react or frustrated receives environment cues (undesirable situations) and display anger to people who are not related to the actual frustration.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Prevention for road rage Before driving:</h5><ul><li><strong>1) Leave before time:</strong> it’s better to reach a bit early than late. When a person has time in hand, they often do not react to negativity.</li><li><strong>2) Settle mood before driving</strong>: If a person is upset or does not have the right frame of mind it’s better to cool down before driving. This will make the entire journey safer.</li></ul><h5 class=wp-block-heading>While driving:</h5><ul><li><strong>1) Give space to another vehicle if they get narrow space to move:</strong> when driving be concerned about another person’s safety as well. If the driver observes that another person is facing difficulty in crossing the road getting in between two vehicles they should give space to another driver.</li><li><strong>2) Avoid honking: </strong>Too much of the horn will not release the traffic or change the traffic signal. Horn is used to ask for space and warn another driver or person who is walking on the road. Misusing it will only irritate another person or driver.</li><li><strong>3) Never confront a vehicle if a person can see no space: </strong>Sometimes the road fight begins with who will give a pass to the vehicle. Both the parties are not ready for this and they stay where they are and get into road rage. It’s better to assess the road space and wait if they observe less space or huge traffic.</li><li><strong>4) Use of hand gestures and words</strong>: be very alert while giving hand gestures or talking with the driver. Sometimes misunderstanding can create road rage. Also, be broad-minded while receiving another person’s gestures and signals.</li></ul><h5 class=wp-block-heading>What to do when another person is an aggressive driver:</h5><li><strong>Keep distance: </strong>Make a proper distance from the aggressive driver when you are in the vehicle of the outside of the vehicle. They can get into physical fights at any point of time.</li><li><strong>Keep moving: </strong>When you stay at a place aggressive drivers get an opportunity to hard or disturb more to another person. So it’s better to keep moving and close windows.</li><li><strong>Be cautious:</strong> Be very aware of every action or move of such a driver. Better to seek help when recognise any red flag of road rage. I</li><li><strong>Don’t reciprocate:</strong> Don’t reciprocate when the aggressive driver is showing odd gestures or abusive words. Stay patient and let the person pass. It’s more important to reach home safely then to reach home with a winning fight.</li><li><strong>Don’t come out of the car: </strong>When an aggressive driver ask you to come out of the car, do not follow his instruction. Ask him to take you from wherever you are.</li><li><strong>Avoid eye contact: </strong>Avoid Eye contact as this can charge the aggressive driver even more.</li><p>Patience is the ultimate solution to road rage. Be calm when face aggressive drive and while driving don’t get easily triggered can help the person reach home safely.</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Empowering Minds: Revolutionizing Teenage Mental Health in India</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychological First Aid (PFA): An Immediate Assistance to</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>The Psychology of Stereotypes</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 16, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Incantations Vs.
