The added show marks the first time any music group has played the building on consecutive nights. They are now set to play Biloxi July 19-20.</p><p><b>Concerts Return To Lower Manhattan</b></p><p>More than 500 <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/sheryl-crow-plunkett.gif border=0 align=right style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> free concerts, 1,500 acts and cultural events have returned to 20 venues in lower Manhattan, just nine months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. The budget is a whopping $7.6 million. The weekday noon-2 PM free concerts on the World Trade Center Plaza between the former Twin Towers has been shifted to Fulton Street Seaport, about a half a mile to the East on the East River. Tuesdays are oldies, Wednesdays are jazz with CD 101.9, Thursdays are rock with Q 104.3 and Fridays are blues with Bloomberg–Mose Allison and John Hammond are the only two announced bookings.</p><p>Some of the highlights include Sheryl Crow's May 30 performance at the Lawn at Battery Park, sponsored by American Express, with 10,000 patrons receiving ponchos, shirts and cushions. The Jazz Orchestra of Lincoln Center featuring Wynton Marsalis plays on July 4 while Cassandra Wilson's performance is timed for the last big summer holiday, Labor Day. Other Battery Park concerts include Vernon Reid and James "Blood" Ulmer, John Scofield and Jerry Douglas at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Park in Battery Park City; The Klezmatics, Duke Robillard and The Hiram Bullock Trio at the Robert F. Wagner, Jr. Park at Battery Park City; and Roseanne Cash, Jane Siberry and The Derek Trucks band at the Castle Clinton National Monument in Battery Park.</p><p>Randy Newman, Lea Delaria and Toshi Reagon will perform on the Plaza of the World Financial Center.</p><p><b>Sandstone Amphitheatre Renamed Verizon Wireless Amphitheater</b></p><p>In a seven-year deal, Verizon Wireless <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/sandst.jpg border=0 align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> has acquired the naming rights to Sandstone Amphitheatre in Bonner Springs, KS — its seventh such amphitheater title. Financial terms were not disclosed.</p><p>"This is a very exciting day for Clear Channel Entertainment, Verizon Wireless and Kansas City music fans," said Patrick Leahy, Clear Channel Entertainment’s Central-Region COO – Music. "Verizon Wireless Amphitheater is one of America’s premier concert venues, and we are thrilled that Verizon Wireless recognizes the abundant opportunities provided by having its name connected to a venue famous for attracting the biggest names in entertainment."</p><p>"The sponsorship of Kansas City’s best-known music entertainment venue is part of our aggressive strategy to increase awareness of the Verizon Wireless brand," said Mark Crumpton, President of Kansas/Missouri Verizon Wireless. "It is a good match for us, because many of the people who enjoy performances at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater lead busy, active lives. We believe they are likely to embrace our advanced wireless technology to stay in touch with friends, family and work."</p><p><b>Lincoln National Buys Stadium Naming Rights</b></p><p>US Life insurer Lincoln <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/philly-stadium.jpg border=0 align=right style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> National Corporation has purchased the naming rights to the new 67,000-seat NFL Philadelphia Eagles stadium being built. The company is paying $139.6 million to have the stadium called Lincoln Financial Field.</p><p>Lincoln will pay the NFL team about $6.7 million annually for 21 years, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. The Eagles' are putting $320 million into the building of the $512 million stadium, scheduled to open next year.</p><p>Lincoln National Corp is the sixth largest US life insurer.</p><p><b>Lincoln Center Name Dispute Simmers</b></p><p>NEW YORK (AP) — Music has <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/avery-fisher-hall.gif border=0 align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> been resonating for decades from the stage of Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall, world famous as the home of The New York Philharmonic.</p><p>But as the center develops plans to substantially renovate the concert hall or build a new one, the family of the late philanthropist fears the Fisher name will be dropped to make way for a new benefactor willing to pay the bill.</p><p>Fisher's heirs are prepared to go to court to protect the name, although the two sides say they will meet this week to try to work out an understanding. The outcome, analysts say, could set a precedent for how philanthropists and cultural organizations negotiate naming rights.</p><p>Fisher, an electronics mogul, donated $10.5 million in 1973 to rebuild the acoustically flawed Philharmonic Hall first erected in 1962. There was one condition: the hall must be named after him in perpetuity.</p><p>"In perpetuity means forever, and if we have to go to court to protect the name, we will," said Fisher family attorney William Zabel. "But we hope to work it out. We really don't want to go to court."</p><p>Lincoln Center's president, Reynold Levy, said he hopes to "amicably settle this matter with the Fisher family. We intend to continue discussion to reach a positive conclusion."</p><p>But Levy also noted that Lincoln Center is undertaking a 10-year redevelopment of its entire, seven-building campus at a cost expected to top $1 billion.</p><p>Most of that money must be raised through private donors, "and people want their names on things," said Sedgwick Clark, editor of Musical America, classical music's top trade magazine.</p><p>A new or vastly renovated concert hall for the city's premier orchestra could easily top $300 million.</p><p>Peter Frumkin, a Harvard University professor who teaches about philanthropy and nonprofit organizations, said the disagreement reflects a change in the unwritten rules that have long guided philanthropists and their beneficiaries.</p><p>"In the past," he said, "gifts were generally conveyed on an honorary system, and the organization would recognize the person. Over time, that genteel system has been replaced with a more contractual system. Donors want recognition, and the gift has gone from being a gift to being a contract."</p><p>Fisher died in 1994, leaving his family the fortune he had made producing the first transistorized amplifier and the first stereo radio-phonograph combination.</p><p>A tribute to a past donor could well take a back seat in the current financial climate. Lincoln Center — also home to the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet, the New York City Opera and other major cultural organizations — can no longer rely on public aid from a city facing multibillion-dollar deficits.</p><p>Levy said there's plenty of money waiting to be given away.</p><p>"The 1990s have witnessed the largest aggregation of private wealth in the history of this country," said Levy, a former professor at Harvard Business School. "And while the stock market has declined, private wealth is in much better shape today than it was a decade ago. This is a very positive climate in which to raise money for worthy causes."</p><p><b>Fans to Mark Last Elvis Show</b></p><p>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The last building <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/elvis-ap-photo.gif border=0 align=right style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> that Elvis left may be gone, but some fans are doing their part to make sure it's not forgotten.</p><p>When Elvis Presley took the stage at Market Square Arena during the summer of 1977, no one knew it would be his last show.</p><p>On June 26, the 25th anniversary of that concert, a group of Presley fans will dedicate a historical marker at the site where the arena stood until it was demolished last year.</p><p>The marker will bear an inscription in bronze reading "Ladies and Gentlemen, Elvis has left the building" atop a granite column.</p><p>"We've designed it in such a way that when something else is developed there, hopefully we'll be able to still use it in a cornerstone," said Kay Lipps, chairman of the Taking Care of Presley Memorial Committee.</p><p>The marker will be erected on a street corner overlooking the gravel parking lot where the arena once stood. A time capsule encased within it will hold Presley memorabilia.</p><p>Presley died Aug. 16, 1977, from heart disease worsened by prescription drug abuse.</p><p>"The edifices, the places that we played in, were good places," said Al Dvorin, Presley's show announcer from 1955 until his death. "If the cities have seen fit to put up bigger places, so be it. But our memories lie in places where we've played,"</p><p>Dvorin, whose trademark announcement, "Elvis has left the building, thank you and good night," closed each of Presley's shows, will be on hand for the marker's dedication.</p><p><b>Blues Cruises Add Second Night In New York</b></p><p>Blue Water <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/bwmlogo.gif border=0 align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Music, producers of the New York City Blues Cruise around lower Manhattan, have added another night for the 2002 season.
