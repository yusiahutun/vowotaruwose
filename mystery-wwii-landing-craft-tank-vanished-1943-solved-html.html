been identified as a World War 2.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>LCT 326 was a Mk III 'Landing Craft Tank' designed to land armoured vehicles during amphibious operations, she was built in Middlesbrough and launched in April 1942.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These highly specialised vessels were built in large numbers in the last years of WW2 and were extensively used during the D-day operations of June 1944.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Innes McCartney said: 'The wreck of LCT 326 is one of over 300 sites in Welsh waters which have been surveyed by the Prince Madog and the aim of this particular piece of research is to identify as many offshore wrecks in Welsh waters as possible and shed light on their respective maritime heritage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This aspect of the project has resulted in many new and exciting discoveries relating to both world wars, of which LCT 326 is just one example.'</p><img id=i-63c34f74d5564252

play a pivotal role in helping develop the offshore renewable energy sector in Wales via the Bangor University led SEACAMS2 research project, which is examining the effect that shipwrecks have on the marine environment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Michael Roberts the lead researcher, said: 'Establishing the identity of these offshore wrecks and thereby determining how long they have been submerged is crucial in helping us understand how structures interact with marine processes on timescales that are of great interest to the marine renewable energy industry.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Wrecks such as LCT 326 and their associated physical and ecological "footprints" can often provide us with preliminary insights on the nature and properties of the surrounding seabed without having to undertake more complex, challenging and expensive geoscientific surveys.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Initial analysis of the sonar data obtained from the site, including the wreck dimensions and general appearance suggested the wreck was an LCT, further archival research identified the remains as most likely being LCT 326.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Documents in the National Archives show that the ship was part of the 7th LCT Flotilla and was on a transit cruise from Troon, Scotland to Appledore, Devon. The flotilla, under the watch of HMS COTILLION set sail on January 31 1943.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to records at the time the weather was 'heavy' and the flotilla made slow progress south.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The flotilla passed the Isle of Man at daylight on February 1 and continued south, that evening at 6.30pm as the weather freshened again, HMS COTILLION made a check on the flotilla and observed that LCT 326 was still with the convoy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That was the last time LCT 326 was seen, crucially, the position at which this check was made was recorded as being just northwest of Bardsey Island.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The wreck has now been identified as being located in a position 25 miles further south from where LCT 326 was last seen and in near-perfect line with the flotilla's course lying in over 90m of water.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The dimensions and appearance of the wreck from the sonar data show that it is 58m long and 10m wide, which is similar to the dimensions of a MKIII LCT.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The wreck is shown to be in two halves, lying on the seabed 130m apart.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This vessel appears to have foundered in heavy seas sometime after it was last seen and probably broke in half just forward of the bridge, with both halves staying afloat long enough to have become separated by 130m.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The sonar data clearly shows key features of the vessel such as its distinctive landing gangway and stern deck house and although the cause of the loss of this vessel remains unknown - and a mine explosion or collision cannot be absolutely ruled out - the evidence suggests this may have been nothing more than a tragic marine accident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The location of this naval grave will now be reported to the Admiralty, so that the records can be corrected and the resting place of the 14 crew accurately recorded.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Echoes from the Deep: Modern Reflections on our Maritime Past' is funded by the Leverhulme Trust and will be published in 2021.</p><img id=i-24a5387f27088f81 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/07/19/28127742-8297957-image-a-11_1588876002253.jpg height=640 width=962 alt="The remains of the LCT were found by the survey vessel Prince Madog, pictured, which is charting shipwrecks along the Welsh coast" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The remains of the LCT were found by the survey vessel Prince Madog, pictured, which is charting shipwrecks along the Welsh coast</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKFc4WWcmxwZ32uwLWx0bJkkI95fnqtrc2doKefXZi%2ForLTZquapptiw6K6yKyfnpxdZoZ1f4yspqWulZl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmystery-wwii-landing-craft-tank-vanished-1943-solved-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmystery-wwii-landing-craft-tank-vanished-1943-solved-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmystery-wwii-landing-craft-tank-vanished-1943-solved-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmystery-wwii-landing-craft-tank-vanished-1943-solved-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmystery-wwii-landing-craft-tank-vanished-1943-solved-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmystery-wwii-landing-craft-tank-vanished-1943-solved-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-andre-300-quit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-andre-300-quit.html>Why Did Andre 3000 Quit?
