At first, his parents were devastated, but he did not let his disability affect him mentally. He was bullied at school, and people laughed at him, but he never lost hope.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Vujicic was shown an article about a person with a serious physical disability, he realised he was not alone and that he could put his life to good use.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He prayed to God for guidance and slowly mastered daily tasks with his two toes. Vujicic gives talks to inspire and encourage people to never give up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I would like to meet him in a church for the interview. That's where his life changed, when he started believing in God.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pradyumn Dayal, 12, German Swiss International School</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If I could interview one person, it would be Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook. The social networking site has 850 million users and is valued at US$100 billion. So everyone who has an account is worth more than US$100 to Facebook, although its users don't have to pay anything.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Questions I would ask him include: 'How do you build a business from scratch?', 'What do you think of China banning Facebook?' and 'Who is your inspiration?'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I would love to meet him in the library of the Phillips Exeter Academy, in the US, where he studied. Actually, I am going there for a summer programme this year, so such a meeting would be truly meaningful.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Joyce Chan Ching-yan, 16, Maryknoll Fathers' School</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It would be Emma Watson, because she is a talented actress and her role in the Harry Potter films is part of my childhood memories. She started acting in the series when she was just nine years old - she is now 22 and a celebrity. She has also done brilliantly academically.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">First, I would like to ask her how she handles pressure from the public. Then, what made her cut her hair and whether she was afraid of upsetting her fans with her new look. How did she choose her university? Did she miss out on memorable times with her high school friends because she was filming the series? Does she play any sports to overcome her stress? I would want to meet her in a quiet place in Britain, so we could chat comfortably.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The prize!</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ultimate Brain Game winner will receive a set of eight awesome books, including Inheritance: The Vault of Souls, Tiger's Curse and Life of Pi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdpboN4gZdooJ9lqaTCbq%2FOrqOdZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGWRo8ZuvMSrqqimXaG2t7XNoGSwoJ9ixLDBy51koqxdl7Juw8eeqZ5lp6TCrbCMsqauZZ2asrV5wKeb</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fif-you-could-interview-any-person-living-who-would-it-be-where-would-you-meet-and.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fif-you-could-interview-any-person-living-who-would-it-be-where-would-you-meet-and.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fif-you-could-interview-any-person-living-who-would-it-be-where-would-you-meet-and.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fif-you-could-interview-any-person-living-who-would-it-be-where-would-you-meet-and.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fif-you-could-interview-any-person-living-who-would-it-be-where-would-you-meet-and.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fif-you-could-interview-any-person-living-who-would-it-be-where-would-you-meet-and.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jeff-macke.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jeff-macke.html>Jeff Macke Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./barstool-sports-ceo-erika-nardini-left-banker-husband-married-squash-coach-html.html>Barstool Sports CEO Erika Nardini 'left her banker husband for her married squash coach'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./barstool-sports-ceo-erika-nardini-left-banker-husband-married-squash-coach-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
