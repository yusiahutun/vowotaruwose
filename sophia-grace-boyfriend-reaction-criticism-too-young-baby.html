While she opened up about her recent pregnancy on October 22, her partner in that endeavor remains largely a mystery.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4c446c13-3105-43d8-b1ac-c71f8747efc7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:67b877c8-11bc-4f14-9b86-c66fea8f8e6b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3f/5by4/2022/10/22/3f2ba52d2f1b4641ae4edce0467857e3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Ellen DeGeneres Show Star Sophia Grace Reveals She's Pregnant with First Child</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Because I have always been in the spotlight, I feel like I want something just to keep to myself," Grace told <a href=#>E!

"It will definitely change us into proper adults and then we can grow up together and have a family."</p><p>She said he was immediately happy when she shared the news. "Obviously both quite shocked at the start and also overwhelmed because he's young also," added Sophia, who's 19. "But now that we're getting used to it, we're both really excited."</p><p>19 years old is definitely seen as young -- or even too young -- by some people, who weren't shy in sharing their opinions about her life and choices on her YouTube channel.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fe8e7dfc-1045-497a-9ad9-d0c84080e3c8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:67b877c8-11bc-4f14-9b86-c66fea8f8e6b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ea/5by4/2022/05/12/ea21f92f164f47bc83994a0b813f7eed_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Warner Bros./Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Watch Sophia Grace and Rosie Return to Ellen One Last Time -- and Sing the Song that Made Them Famous</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Even Sophia acknowledges that 19 is young, telling <a href=#>E! News</a> that "most people are like, â€˜You should have babies when you're 30 and you're married and you live in your own house,' which is completely fine."</p><p>But that doesn't mean it's the right path for everyone. "As long as you feel ready and it's something that you're happy about, then it's really no one else's problem," she said.</p><p>Conversely in a positive way, she's also seen tremendous support from her fans, which she says has helped lift her up and give her confidence.</p><p>For now, she's leaning into the support of friends and family and feeling positive and excited about her growing family.</p><p>In her announcement video on October 22, Sophia Grace said that she was 21 weeks along, and teased that this could go so far as to change the direction of her channel.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8d82f659-a3a8-4281-8c77-3b9f80e94619 data-container-ref=toofab:article:67b877c8-11bc-4f14-9b86-c66fea8f8e6b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/eb/5by4/2022/10/22/eba6594d2d9c454e870b52a463f9ad85_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mandy Moore Gives Birth, Welcomes Second Baby Boy with Husband Taylor Goldsmith</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I can't wait to share this journey with you guys and definitely have lots of different content from what I usually have," she said.</p><p>She went on to show off her growing baby bump to the camera. Standing up, she said, "At the moment, it is sort of sticking out a little bit, definitely more than it usually does. It's kind of swollen a little bit. So this is what I look like at five months."</p><p>Sophia shared some sonogram photos she'd received, sharing that the scans went well and everything was looking good for her and her baby.</p><p>At the time, she asked her followers to "only comment nice things because we need lots of positivity," and stressed that "negative comments will be deleted." Unfortunately, plenty of negative comments were and are sprinkled across her social media pages.</p><p>Promising new videos every Saturday, Sophia teased that in the next one, she would be revealing the gender of her video, which she already knows -- but strategically did not revel at all!</p><a id=gallery-link-9ae02192-147a-492a-b81f-204f44e153e3 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9ae02192-147a-492a-b81f-204f44e153e3 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:67b877c8-11bc-4f14-9b86-c66fea8f8e6b data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ff/4by3/2022/12/22/ff1b8ec212ad4512815df3e0ba164081_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlma21fqLyxtMiaZKCqkZiybq7Osp2roZWjsW6%2BxJqaraGfo3qkvsitoJyho6J6tbvOZrCorZ6ceqOtwbJm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsophia-grace-boyfriend-reaction-criticism-too-young-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsophia-grace-boyfriend-reaction-criticism-too-young-baby.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsophia-grace-boyfriend-reaction-criticism-too-young-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsophia-grace-boyfriend-reaction-criticism-too-young-baby.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsophia-grace-boyfriend-reaction-criticism-too-young-baby.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsophia-grace-boyfriend-reaction-criticism-too-young-baby.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tess-daly-sequin-top-leather-mini-skirt-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tess-daly-sequin-top-leather-mini-skirt-photos.html>Tess Daly is a total glamazon in mini skirt and shimmering sequins</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./miss-usa-2019-cheslie-kryst-posthumous-memoir-mental-health-struggles-ahead-of-suicide.html>Miss USA 2019 Cheslie Kryst's Posthumous Memoir Details Mental Health Struggles Ahead of Suicide</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./miss-usa-2019-cheslie-kryst-posthumous-memoir-mental-health-struggles-ahead-of-suicide.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
