It was a great opportunity."</p><p>Lemar performed to Coldplay's Viva La Vida, while Donna performed to Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper but the judges voted to save Donna and her partner Mark unanimously.</p><p>Love was in the air tonight on Dancing on Ice – as the skaters got in the Valentine’s Day spirit early with a romantic themed week.</p><p>Here’s everything that you missed from today’s show…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-19h51m49s139.png><h2><strong>Kem Cetinay and Alex Murphy – What Makes You Beautiful by One Direction</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000384402529.jpg><p>After their fate on today’s competition was thrown into doubt after Alex suffered an accident during rehearsals, Kem and Alex opened the show and earned a respectable 29 out of 40.</p><p>With his grandparents in the audience, Kem admitted that he was feeling the pressure as the routines got more difficult – and the judges were quick to tell him it showed.</p><p>However, Alex was full of pride for her protégé, and said: “I’m so pleased, he’s the best partner, he’s amazing. We fight, but he’s amazing.”</p><p>Judge Jason Gardiner warned him that his technique was lacking, and told him: “You’re quite scratchy still with the skating compared to the other celebrities. There’s times when you’re in the routine that you look like a toddler.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Kem Cetinay and Alex Murphy skate to What Makes You Beautiful by One Direction on Dancing On Ice</span><p>And Ashley Banjo told him to be careful with his performance, and said: “I did enjoy it, it was hard.

I liked the beginning but then it just didn't continue."</p><p>"Lemar, I've asked you to really connect with the emotion of the movement," he added. "This is a piece where you really should've done that and you didn't do it again this week."</p><h3>Total Score: 20/40</h3><h2>Max Evans&nbsp;<strong>and Ale Izquierdo</strong> - I Believe in a Thing Called Love by The Darkness</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000384404522.jpg><p>Max and Ale channelled their inner rockers for classic track I Believe In a Thing Called Love.</p><p>Pulling out all the stops, the duo included a series of complicated lifts in the routine in order to gain points, including an assisted backflip.</p><p>Jordan praised them and said: "You came you took risks and it paid off," giving them 7.5.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Max Evans and Ale Izquierdo skate to I Believe In A Thing Called Love by The Darkness on Dancing On Ice</span><p>"I like that you're attempting the more difficult lifts," Jayne praised, before adding she only didn't give them more marks because some of the landings were off.</p><p>Jason Gardiner and Holly Willoughby also gave the wardrobe team a note of thanks for having Max show off his chest.</p><h3>Total Score: 29/40</h3><h2>Antony Cotton&nbsp;<strong>and Brandee Malto</strong> - Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000384406296.jpg><p>Antony's routine this week proved to be emotional for both him and his professional partner - as they told the story of a soldier going to war.</p><p>The poignant routine proved to be sentimental for both of them.</p><p>Brandee also revealed that her father was shot during the Vietnam War and now suffers from PTSD as a result, crying in the tape before the performance.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Antony Cotton and Brandee Malto skate to Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon & Garfunkel on Dancing On Ice</span><p>It's routine earned them their highest score of 21 out of 40, which left them chuffed.</p><p>Chris revealed: "I'm sure your father's very proud of you.
