Here are some interesting things you probably didn't know about Gary Ridgway's former spouse:</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: Don't miss trending Kenyan news. Follow TUKO.co.ke on <a id=https://twitter.com/Tuko_co_ke href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>!</strong></p><h3>1. She was Gary’s third wife</h3><p class=align-left>Judith was not Gary's first wife, nor was Gary his first husband. The duo had been in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">previous marriages</a>. Judith was married to a man whose identity and current whereabouts have not been revealed. The couple had two children, Marie Lynch and Rachel Lynch.</p><p class=align-left>Gary had married twice. He first married his <a href=#>high school</a> sweetheart, Claudia Kraig Barrows. The marriage occurred in 1970 when he was around 21 while Claudia was only 19. After the union, he joined the United States Navy, during which his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sexual escapades</a> gave him gonorrhoea and other diseases.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/102ab38ebb93155e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Ginger Kennedy? All to know about Tim Kennedy's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Gary could not straighten his path; thus, they divorced within the first year of the marriage. In 1973, Gary married Marcia Lorene Brown shortly after divorcing Claudia. During that time, the couple was blessed with a son, Matthew. After being together for around eight years, the union ended in divorce in 1981.</p><p class=align-left>After his second divorce, he waited for seven years before marrying again. Finally, he married Judith Mawson in 1988. Unfortunately, Gary's third union followed the same route as the first two. After 13 years of being together, the union ended in divorce in 2002.</p><h3>2. Her marriage to Gary was almost perfect</h3><p class=align-left>Green River Killer's wife was in an almost perfect union with Gary, as she was unaware of all the crimes he had committed until his arrest. Judith and Gary met for the first time in 1985 and started dating shortly after.</p><p class=align-left>Their dating life and relationship were almost perfect and lasted around three years before tying the knot. The couple exchanged their wedding vows in 1988. Throughout the dating and marriage, Judith claimed that Gary treated her like a queen and made her happy the best way he knew.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1843aee0bf1fc580.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Melissa Hudson Bell? All about W. Kamau Bell's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The union was blissful until 2001 when Gary was arrested for crimes relating to the murder of different women. After Judith discovered the truth behind her husband's identity and undertakings, she filed for divorce. It was finalized in 2002.</p>I was crying. No, it can't be him. Then I found out that he'd had the carpets removed because he'd killed women on them, and there were bloodstains. He'd had sex with some of them on the bed and killed them. I look back and think, 'Was my life real with him or did he just use me?'<h3>3. Her husband committed a series of murders</h3><p class=align-left>Judith’s husband has committed a <a href=#>series</a> of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">criminal acts</a> over the years until his arrest and sentence. He was described as a not-so-normal child due to some of his behaviours growing up.</p><p class=align-left>Even though he was a weird boy growing up, he waited until the 1980s to start hunting for women. Most of Gary’s victims were sex workers and young runaway girls. Then, after having sex with these women, he strangled them to death. It is alleged that he would return to some of the bodies he had killed and continue having sex with them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f13e5f84f4c4f99.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Evelyn Melendez still married to Jordan Knight? All the details</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He would sometimes travel for miles to get rid of these bodies. Gary was so good at covering his tracks that he was not caught until 20 years later. After marrying Judith, the number of crimes Gary committed reduced. Out of the supposed 70 to 90 women she killed, he only murdered three women during his marriage to Judith.</p><h3>4. She divorced Gary for the crimes he committed</h3><p class=align-left>Green River Killer's wife divorced her killer husband after <a href=#>discovering the crimes</a> he had committed. In 1982 and 2001, Gary was arrested for prostitution-related crimes but was not called out as a murderer. As a result, his now ex-wife has no reason to suspect or doubt him.</p><p class=align-left>In 1983, Gary was one of the key suspects in the Green River Killings; the following year, he passed a lie detector test (a polygraph test). Lorraine said she had never heard of Green River Killer until Gary was arrested in 2001.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f427df8cd156b95.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Marcelene Octave?

However, Judith still did not leave him because she believed the police had arrested the wrong victim. Subsequently, Judith Lynch heard Gary's testimony, after which she resolved to end the union in divorce. Gary pleaded guilty to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">49 charges</a> of first-degree murder.</p><h3>5. She has moved on with her life</h3><p class=align-left>What happened to Judith Ridgway? After divorcing her serial killer husband, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, she moved on with her life. However, it is alleged that she has chosen to remain single because she finds it challenging to trust a man due to her experience with her ex-husband.</p><p class=align-left>Even though her love life seems stagnant, all the other aspects of her life seem to be moving on well. Judith has appeared in many interviews as one of the wives of serial killers giving her account of the ordeals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/25e053decc079e84.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Mary Beougher?

He is currently serving his sentence at the Washington State Penitentiary. On 30th November 2001, Gary was arrested for killings of:</p><ul><li>Opal Mills</li><li>Marcia Chapman</li><li>Carol Ann Christensen</li><li>Cynthia Hinds</li></ul><p class=align-left>Later, he confessed to more killings and claimed that there were others. Finally, to avoid the death penalty, Gary took a plea. The plea bargain set the following terms:</p><ul><li>He admits to all his crimes, not just the seven in the indictment, and he would be spared the death penalty.</li><li>He is to be convicted of all seven murders and possibly face a death sentence</li></ul><p class=align-left>On <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">18th December 2003,</a> he was sentenced to 48 life sentences without the possibility of parole.</p><p class=align-left>Despite her life turning into a rollercoaster, Judith Lorraine Lynch was only a woman in love. But unfortunately, she caught herself in one of the most gruesome and highly-talked-about serial killings in the United States. This was due to her marriage to Gary Ridgway, who murdered between 70 and 90 women in 20 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3223d46fcdb42655.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Summer Walker's boyfriend: background, family, and career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about <a href=#>Noelle Inguagiato Watters.</a> She is a Scottish-Irish fashion stylist from New York.
