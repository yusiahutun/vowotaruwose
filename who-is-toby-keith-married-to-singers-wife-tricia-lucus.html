<time>09 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Through his difficult <a href=#>stomach cancer battle</a>, <a href=#><strong>Toby Keith</strong></a> had his wife, <strong>Tricia Lucus</strong>, by his side. The country music star was grateful for his partner of more than 35 years and their supportive family. He died in February 2024, his family announced in a statement.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Toby Keith’s Wife Tricia Lucus?</strong></h2><p>Toby and Tricia first met at a bar when he was just starting to find his footing in the music industry. He was 20 and she was 19 at the time. It was Toby’s personality that drew Tricia to him. “He was just one of those larger-than-life guys, full of confidence,” she told <a href=#>People</a> in June 2001.</p><p>After three years of dating, the couple got married in 1984. Tricia recalled some of her husband’s sweet gestures after their nuptials.</p><p>“Most people think he is just the most romantic person on the planet,” she said. “He has his moments of charm. It is nice to get a bouquet of flowers, but I’ve told him, ‘Save the money. Roses die in five to seven days. Buy me an outfit or take me to dinner.’”</p><p>In June 2022, Toby announced that he had been <a href=#>quietly battling stomach cancer</a>.</p><p>“I’ve spent the last six months receiving chemo, radiation and surgery. So far, so good,” the songwriter wrote on Instagram at the time. “I need time to breathe, recover and relax. I am looking forward to spending this time with my family. But I will see the fans sooner than later. I can’t wait.”</p><p>In September 2023, Toby made his return to the award show circuit at the inaugural 2023 People’s Choice Country Awards to accept the Country Icon Award.</p><p>“I want to thank my beautiful family that’s here,” he said on stage, with Tricia shedding tears in the audience. “And most of all, I want to thank the fans for still allowing us to do what we do.”</p><p>The longtime pair walked the red carpet together at the event, proving that their marriage withstood the test of time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Who-Is-Toby-Keith-Married-To-Singers-Wife-Tricia-Lucus-.jpg><h2><strong>How Many Kids Did Toby Keith Have?</strong></h2><p>The “Should’ve Been a Cowboy” singer was a dad to daughters <a href=#><strong>Shelley Covel Rowland</strong> and <strong>Krystal Keith</strong> and son <strong>Stelen Keith Covel</strong></a>. Toby and Tricia also became grandparents to several grandkids, including granddaughter Hensley, who loves spending time with the hitmaker.</p><p>In May 2020, Krystal snapped an adorable photo of Toby teaching Hensley how to fish. “He is a pretty good teacher, he taught me how to outfish all the boys … Hensley’s turn,” she captioned the Instagram post.</p><h2>How Did Toby Keith Die?</h2><p>Toby’s death was <a href=#>announced in a statement</a> shared on X on February 6, 2024.</p><p>“Toby Keith passed peacefully last night on February 5, surrounded by his family,” the statement read. “He fought his fight with grace and courage. Please respect the privacy of his family at this time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6tbvBsmSknZmptW65wKupop2UYsGwedKipaCdoqh6uLXFnmStqpmYtqJ5y66arqtf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-toby-keith-married-to-singers-wife-tricia-lucus.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-toby-keith-married-to-singers-wife-tricia-lucus.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-toby-keith-married-to-singers-wife-tricia-lucus.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-toby-keith-married-to-singers-wife-tricia-lucus.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-toby-keith-married-to-singers-wife-tricia-lucus.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-toby-keith-married-to-singers-wife-tricia-lucus.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jared-goff-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jared-goff-wife.html>Who's He Married, Engaged To?
