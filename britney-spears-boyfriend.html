The two met after they laid eyes on each other at the club. “I met her at a club in Hollywood, Joseph’s. Our eyes met and that was it. We just hit it off right away,” the dancer recalled in 2008. “I was madly in love with her. Everything just seemed so right. I didn’t see it as too fast or too slow.”</p><p>They became engaged in July 2004 after three months of dating. In November 2006, Britney filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for both physical and legal custody of their two sons, with visitation rights for Federline. Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, however, in October 2007, a court ruled to grant Federline sole physical custody of&nbsp;their sons&nbsp;<a href=#>Jayden James</a>&nbsp;and Sean Preston due to Britney’s “habitual, frequent and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol” at the time, according to the judge.</p><p>Around this time, Spears was placed under a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conservatorship</a>&nbsp;led by her dad, Jamie Spears, and her lawyer, Andrew Wallet. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conservators</a>&nbsp;over Spears’ person and estate, her father and her attorney had access to her doctors and medical records, could limit who visits her and had control over the financial decisions she makes. After her conservatorship was created, Spears and Federline were back to 50/50 custody over their kids. However, their agreement changed again in September 2019, when K-Fed was given 70 percent custody, while Spears was given 30 percent unsupervised custodial rights, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a>. That change was confirmed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;in March 2021 after a source told the magazine that Spears sees her sons “less” after Federline altered their custody agreement.</p><p>In 2022, it was reported that her sons were estranged. Jayden James told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;that he and his brother had a falling out with Spears. Federline said her nude selfies on social media were “tough” for the boys to deal with publicly. “I try to explain to them, ‘Look, maybe that’s just another way she tries to express herself.’ But that doesn’t take away from the fact of what it does to them. It’s tough.” He added: “I can’t imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.”</p><p>On not attending her wedding to Asghari, Jayden James said: “At the time it just wasn’t a good time to go. I’m not saying that I’m not happy for her,” Jayden said. “I’m really happy for them, but she didn’t invite the whole family, and then if it was just going to be me and Preston, I just don’t see how that situation would have ended on good terms.” He continued that their relationship can “100% … be fixed. It’s just going to take a lot of time and effort. I just want her to get better mentally. When she gets better I really want to see her again.”</p><p>Hours after the interview was published, Spears&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied in a statement on her Instagram</a>, where she sent her son “all the love in the world to you every day for the rest of my life !!!!” She continued: “My love for my children has no boundaries and it deeply saddens me to know his outcry of saying I wasn’t up to his expectations of a mother … and maybe one day we can meet face to face and talk about this openly !!!!”</p><p>Federline and his sons live in Hawaii after his current partner Victoria Prince, landed a job there. Federline’s attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan confirmed to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Page Six</a>&nbsp;that Spears had contact with her kids before they left for their new home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfl7%2BqwM2esGaroJqus7%2BMm6aynqKesq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbritney-spears-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbritney-spears-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./64f0ea2522601d4c248b4615-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./64f0ea2522601d4c248b4615-html.html>Gaming: Trucos de GTA V para Xbox 360: armas, dinero, tanque y todas las claves</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beaming-lorraine-kelly-rocks-black-bob-cascading-veil-rare-wedding-photo-with-lookalike-father.html>Beaming Lorraine Kelly rocks black bob and cascading veil in rare wedding photo with lookalike fathe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beaming-lorraine-kelly-rocks-black-bob-cascading-veil-rare-wedding-photo-with-lookalike-father.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
