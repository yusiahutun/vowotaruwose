Is Stephen Hayes, though? Let’s investigate the news anchor’s spouse in detail.</strong></p><p>Theo Hayes is a well-known journalist and television host who is most known for serving as WBAL-TV 11 News’s regular face.</p><p>The graduate of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has held positions at several stations. She worked for five years as a reporter and morning anchor at WMBF News before coming to WBAL in 2017.</p><p>Following her recent arrest for driving while intoxicated, the American presenter caused quite a stir. Her personal life has consequently drawn attention from the media.</p><p>In terms of her private life, she is a married lady. However, who is Stephen Hayes, her spouse? Let’s learn more about the WBAL presenter’s spouse and family in today’s article.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Stephen_Hayes_Theo_Hayes8217s_Husband>Who Is Stephen Hayes, Theo Hayes’s Husband?</span></h2><p>The official of WBAL-TV 11 News Stephen Hayes and Theo Hayes have been wed for a number of years. The devoted couple has a daughter together.</p><p>Theo Hayes and her partner would rather live their lives out of the spotlight. Theo’s relationship with her beau is largely unknown. It is therefore unknown how the two lovebirds met and fell in love.</p><p>According to a number of websites, President Rutherford B. Hayes’ great-great-grandson is Stephen Hayes, the spouse of Theo Hayes. These allegations appear to have originated from a 1977 New York Times story regarding Mary Theo Toumey and Stephen Hayes’ marriage.</p><p>The WBAL-TV host was most likely born in the late 1970s or early 1980s, it should be noted. Thus, Theo from WBAL is probably not the same individual as Theo from the 1977 NY Times article.</p><h2><span id=Parental_and_sibling_backgrounds_of_Theo_Hayes>Parental and sibling backgrounds of Theo Hayes</span></h2><p>The news presenter Theo Hayes has concealed not just her marriage life but also her origins and family history.</p><p>In any case, we presume that Theo Hayes, the news anchor, had a happy upbringing. Her WBAL profile states that she spent her early years in Okinawa, Japan. She visited twelve other nations as well.</p><p>Does Theo Hayes’ mother have Japanese ancestry? How she managed to live in Japan remains unknown. Maybe in the near future, we may discover more about the news anchor.</p><h2><span id=Theo_Hayes8217s_Career_and_Net_Worth>Theo Hayes’s Career and Net Worth</span></h2><p>Theo Hayes has worked in the media for more than ten years. Over the course of her lengthy and impressive career, she must have amassed a sizeable wealth.</p><p>The salary range for a news anchor at WBAL-TV is $51K to $197K, according to Payscale. Therefore, the compensation of the Journalist from Baltimore must also fall within that range. Additionally, the remuneration is determined by the experience and talent of the worker.</p><p>Theo Hayes has a great reputation in the field, thus her yearly average pay should be remarkable.</p><p>According to reports, Theo began working as a reporter and weekend anchor for WBAL-TV 11 News in October 2017. She moved from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Baltimore.</p><p>She spent five years working as a reporter and morning anchor at WMBF News. In an effort to improve the neighborhood, Hayes covered high-profile incidents there, including the kidnapping of Heather Elvis, the murder of Brittanee Drexel, and the devastation brought on by Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.</p><p>Before her time at the beach, Theo was the 6 p.m. anchor for 6News Lawrence, Kansas. She also reported for WVTV in Milwaukee and KLBK/KAMC in Lubbock, Texas. She also worked as a freelance reporter for KNBC and LACityView in the past.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>journalist and television host</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Sarah Reid Married To Her Boyfriend Jeremy Hall | Journalist Relationship</a></h3>Discover Sarah Reid's husband and family details, since many people are interested in her after her purported resignation from Global News.Sarah Reid is a well-known figure in Canada's thriving me <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Felton Spencer Wife | Was Louisville Basketball Player Married | Family And Net Worth Before Death</a></h3>Felton Spencer was a well-known center who played professionally for many different basketball teams.
