J. Cole's journey in basketball gained lots of media attention, as the rapper even graced the cover of SLAM Magazine. Having said that, news about Cole's basketball career has been quiet recently. Let's take a look at J. Cole's career and find out if he is still hooping.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-j-cole-s-early-basketball-career>J.

(Photo by Michael Hickey/Getty Images)</p><p>J. Cole's basketball career began when he was a child, first in a rec league then, at Terry Sanford High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina. After he was cut from the varsity team in his first two years of high school, Cole went on to become a starter in his senior year. He had faith that he could play at the Division 1 level of college basketball but ultimately, attended St. John's University on an academic scholarship. There, J Cole tried out for the university's basketball team as a walk-on and made it to the final ten out of 70-80 players. According to Cole, he was not cut by the team but instead, elected not to play because he believed he wasn't ready for the commitment or lifestyle. Despite this, J. Cole frequently practiced with St. John's women's team and played intramural basketball.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beginning-of-professional-career>Beginning of Professional Career</h2></span><p>KIGALI, RWANDA - MAY 16: Jermaine Cole #15 of the Patriots Basketball Club is congratulated by teammate Brandon Costner #33 during the second half against the Rivers Hoopers Basketball Club at Kigali Arena on May 16, 2021 in Kigali, Rwanda.

Cole shared an article with The Player's Tribune that detailed his desire to play in the NBA after he graduated from college. In the article, he stated, "If I can blow up in the next three years, that means I'll only be 27. That still might give me enough time to train and pursue a professional basketball career. I'll work hard enough to go play overseas and then try to work my way to the NBA." A few weeks after The Player's Tribune article, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Master P</a> confirmed J. Cole was training for the NBA.</p><p>Though he didn't make it to the big leagues, in 2021, J. Cole signed a contract with <a href=# rel>Rwanda-based Patriots Basketball Club</a> in the Basketball Africa League. Finally, Cole found himself one step closer to the NBA. In his first game with the Patriots, Cole played seventeen minutes and finished with three points, three rebounds, and two assists against Rivers Hoopers.</p><p>J. Cole went on to play two more games for the Patriots Basketball Club. In his time with the team, he averaged 1.7 points, 1.7 rebounds, and one assist in fifteen minutes per game. Cole's contract stated that he must play a minimum of three games. He fulfilled his obligations and shortly after his third game, Cole left the team. Despite the small sample size, J. Cole proved he could play basketball on a professional level. Along with this, his professional career continued in Canada.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scarborough-shooting-stars-stint>Scarborough Shooting Stars Stint</h2></span><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/Cekd_C9lJjK/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading</p></figure><p>On May 19, 2022, J. Cole signed with the <a href=# rel>Scarborough Shooting Stars</a> of the Canadian Elite Basketball League -- the premier basketball league in Canada. Players in the league are expected to have played either collegiate or international professional basketball. <a href=# rel>J. Cole played four games</a> with the Scarborough Shooting Stars where he averaged &nbsp;2.4 points, 0.6 rebounds, 0.4 assists, and shot 50% from the three-point line. On June 2022, Cole confirmed he was taking an indefinite leave of absence to go on tour.</p><p>In regards to his time with the team, Cole said, "Man, it's&nbsp;been phenomenal. I was telling the guys in there like, 'I'm going for these shows, I'm not sure if I'll be back.' But just in case, I had to let them know how incredible this was. The players, the coaching staff, the organization, the league, it's a crazy thing when you see it on paper, when you see whatâ€™s actually happening, and they made me feel so welcome." J. Cole did not confirm if he would be back in the interview.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-future-of-j-cole-s-basketball-career>The <a href=# class=text-word>Future</a> of J.

Cole's <a href=# rel>basketball career</a> is still up in the air, the rapper has neither confirmed nor denied if it is officially over. Since his leave from the Scarborough Shooting Stars, J. Cole has not played another professional basketball game. While it seems that Cole is currently spending his time on music and his Dreamville label, it is still possible that the rapper may once again return to the court. Whether that be in Canada or somewhere else, it seems that J. Cole has not yet closed the door on <a href=# rel>shooting hoops in the future</a>. Though it may be on hiatus, only time will tell if it is over.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma4B1gJBmoWabn6Gybq7ArKKerJKWua0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f663441-j-cole-basketball.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f663441-j-cole-basketball.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f663441-j-cole-basketball.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f663441-j-cole-basketball.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f663441-j-cole-basketball.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f663441-j-cole-basketball.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./johnny-stevens-bio-career-relationships-affairs-age-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./johnny-stevens-bio-career-relationships-affairs-age-net-worth.html>Johnny Stevens Bio, Career, Relationships, Affairs, Age, &amp;amp; Net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./5e304f5e22601d5c598b45fe-html.html>Iker Pou, veinte aos en la 'novena dimensin': abre una nueva va en Mallorca</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./5e304f5e22601d5c598b45fe-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
