So, how do you win your girlfriend back?</p><p class=align-left>It is quite easy, and you must look for signs of moving on from a relationship. So, what are the biggest indicators?</p><h3>1. They friendzone you</h3><p class=align-left>The easiest way to know she's seeing someone else is by being friend-zoned. You are probably in contact with your ex-girlfriend, but things seem different, not like you were used to.</p><p class=align-left>She suddenly has boundaries and probably sees you occasionally. If she does this, your ex no longer has romantic feelings for you, and she has moved on.</p><p class=align-left>Another sure sign that you have been put in the <a href=#>friend zone</a> is that she no longer struggles to be funny or emotional with you. Again, this is a simple sign that they stopped romantically caring about you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><h3>2. They don't initiate contact</h3><p class=align-left>One of the surest signs she is gone forever is when communication goes down. Texting patterns are easy to read. If you have noticed that your ex-girlfriend's texting patterns have become irregular or she never texts at all, she has moved on.</p><p class=align-left>Another sign to look out for is if you always initiate the conversation and she never texts you. Girls are sentimental and thoughtful regarding text messages. Therefore, if they don't make any effort while texting, they don't care about you.</p><h3>3. She blocks you</h3><p class=align-left>There is no clearer sign that your ex-girlfriend has moved on than when she blocks you. The message here is simple: she doesn’t want to hear from you, period. On top of this, if they alter their phone numbers to avoid instances where you reach out, you can be sure that she is officially done with you. So, of course, it would be better at this point to let her go.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to tell you</span></p></a><h3>4. She wants her stuff back</h3><p class=align-left>When a lady wants her stuff back, it shows that they are ready to start their life somewhere else. However, this can be a confusing sign she has moved on to someone else, as some women might want their stuff back so that they have a reason to communicate with you.</p><p class=align-left>If she truly wants her stuff back without ulterior motives, then it is a sign that she doesn't want to think of you when missing her favourite blanket or something she lent you.</p><h3>5. Your ex goes on dates</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c703037053dfd81a.jpg><p class=align-left>Has she started going on dates with other men? If so, then it is an obvious clue she has moved on and is looking for a perfect match. It doesn't matter whether she informed you or not. Her actions communicate that she is ready to embrace the future, and you are no longer part of it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><h3>6. She has a new boyfriend</h3><p class=align-left>Having a new boyfriend is ab obvious sign that she has moved on with another guy. Remember, if your ex-girlfriend were still hoping to get back with you, they would find it hard to get into another relationship. They wouldn't want to develop feelings for another person.</p><p class=align-left>Your ex-girlfriend being in a <a href=#>new relationship</a> shows she has moved past the grieving stage and is ready to love someone else.</p><h3>7. She doesn’t want to hang out</h3><p class=align-left>Someone who cares about you will find it difficult to stay away, which means they wouldn't mind hanging out. So, if your ex is always opposed to the idea, they have moved on. Not having time to hang out with you means your ex prefers an alternative to spending time with you.</p><h3>8. Your ex no longer flirts with you</h3><p class=align-left>You would agree that there is a thin line between flirting and a regular conversation, depending on how you are used to a person. But, of course, you can know when someone is flirting, and if your ex-girlfriend avoids such instances, it means they want to keep it friendly. And that is something you should worry about as it is a clear sign she has moved on with another guy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/30fb47cab9fc697b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>She stopped texting me out of nowhere! 8 possible reasons why</span></p></a><h3>9. She thinks you need someone better</h3><p class=align-left>Has your girlfriend told you that you deserve someone better? Sorry, she no longer has feelings for you and has moved on. A woman wouldn't say such a thing if they still have a feeling for someone as it hurts.</p><p class=align-left>Advising you to find someone better shows that she no longer pictures herself with you and doesn't envision getting back with you.</p><h3>10. She doesn't show signs of regret</h3><p class=align-left>Breakups are not easy; sometimes, you can see things clearly after the dust settles. However, when this time comes, and you notice that your ex-girlfriend doesn't show any signs of regret, they probably moved on and are in another relationship.</p><h3>11. She is comfortable around you</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg><p class=align-left>Does your ex-girlfriend seem comfortable around you? This is a clear sign that they have moved on. They would be uncomfortable in your presence if they had feelings for you. Your ex-girlfriend would probably be nervous and apprehensive after what happened between you two.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 ways to win a girl who rejected you</span></p></a><h3>12. She doesn't want to talk about the future</h3><p class=align-left>When you are in a relationship with someone, you always see each other building a life together. This, of course, changes after <a href=#>breaking up</a>. But, if they are still interested in getting back with you, they would still see a future.</p><p class=align-left>The opposite is also true. If your girlfriend doesn't want to discuss the future, they have moved on. It probably might be too soon for her, but this is a clear sign that she has moved on from you.</p><h3>13. She upgraded her appearance and lifestyle</h3><p class=align-left>Upgrading appearance and lifestyle can be a good and bad sign. Unfortunately, if you notice that a lady is doing this after a breakup, she is likely entering a new chapter in her life, probably without you. It is one of the most open signs she has already moved on to someone else.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54c257078ed60f4f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to tell if your baby mama still loves you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In such instances, ladies start upgrading their appearance and mindset, finding new hobbies and doing millions of other things they know will improve their lives.</p><h3>14. She's ignoring your social media posts</h3><p class=align-left>When a lady has feelings for you, they will regularly check your social media, even if you don't post anything. On the other hand, if they are not interested in you, they will ignore your social media posts and will not be bothered by anything you post or comment on. It means they are not interested in anything that goes on in your life.</p><h3>15. She no longer talks about you with her friends</h3><p class=align-left>If your ex-girlfriend still had feelings for you, she would mention you often during conversations with her friends. Therefore, if your mutual friends tell you that she hardly mentions you, consider this a sign that she has moved on and you are no longer in her mind.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Seeing your ex moving one is a painful experience, but there is nothing you can do about it.
