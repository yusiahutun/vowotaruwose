The "First Lady of Country Music" had five husbands, including fellow country legend George Jones, and health problems that led to a decades-long addiction to painkillers and contributed to her early death at age 55.</p><img alt="Hair, Face, Hairstyle, Photograph, Eyebrow, Black-and-white, Beauty, Monochrome photography, Lip, Chin, " title="Hair, Face, Hairstyle, Photograph, Eyebrow, Black-and-white, Beauty, Monochrome photography, Lip, Chin, " width=830 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/37/1505487234-tammywynette1970.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Wynette in 1970</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"No other female country singer conveyed the emotion of heartbreak like Tammy Wynette," states a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.tammywynette.com/about/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="website dedicated to the singer" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">website dedicated to the singer</a>. "She endeared herself to millions by singing about topics of everyday life – divorce, loneliness, parenting, passion. Her tearful singing style was the voice of every heartbreak a woman has ever known. Perhaps it's that Tammy herself lived through such tumultuous times that she could convey the emotion of such weighty topics."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Tammy Wynette was born Virginia Wynette Pugh in 1942 in rural Itawamba County, Mississippi. Her father died when she was very young, and her mother remarried, leaving her to be raised by her grandparents. At age 7, she began working long days picking cotton with her family, a lesson in hard work she never forgot. Even after Wynette found fame as a singer, she kept a crystal bowl full of cotton in her home to remind herself of those days in the cotton field.</p><img alt="Tammy Wynette at home in Franklin, TN 1995" title="Tammy Wynette at home in Franklin, TN 1995" width=1024 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/37/1505487137-tammywynette-home-1995-cotton-bowl.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Wynette at home in Franklin, Tennessee, in 1995</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Wynette married Euple Byrd in 1960 at age 18. A construction worker, Byrd had trouble keeping a job so the couple moved from place to place. But Wynette never shied away from hard work and held a variety of jobs, including as a waitress, shoe-factory employee, cocktail waitress, and hair stylist before making her name in country music. In fact, the practical Wynette renewed her cosmetology license every year until her death, just in case she ever had to go back to earning a living as a beautician.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Wynette had two daughters with Byrd by the time she was 20—Gwendolyn and Jacquelyn—and then left him while she was pregnant with their third daughter, Tina, who developed spinal meningitis not long after her birth. By now living in Alabama, Wynette worked as a hairdresser after getting up at 4 a.m. every morning to sing on the "Country Boy Eddie" TV show for a local station.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="dropcap css-1ez97s8 et3p2gv0">In 1966, Wynette and her daughters moved to Nashville so she could try to land a recording contract. Given her lack of experience in the music business, the move was a very risky decision, especially with three little girls dependent on her, but Wynette eventually signed a deal with Epic Records and took the stage name "Tammy Wynette." She married songwriter Don Chapel in 1967.</p><img alt="Hair, Face, Facial expression, Smile, Hairstyle, Blond, Lip, Beauty, Head, Eyebrow, " title="Hair, Face, Facial expression, Smile, Hairstyle, Blond, Lip, Beauty, Head, Eyebrow, " width=1024 height=856 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/37/1505488148-gettyimages-85351108.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">With Epic's backing, Wynette's risk-taking paid off.

She released her Greatest Hits, Volume 1, which became the first album by a female country singer to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, according to Rolling Stone. Wynette also joined the Grand Ole Opry, cementing her country-star status. And she married fellow country star George Jones, beginning a long singing collaboration that continued even after the couple parted ways. Their duets included the No. 1 country hits "Near You" and "Golden Ring." Wynette and Jones had a daughter, Tamala Georgette, the year after they married. Unfortunately, their stormy relationship and Jones' well-documented alcoholism led to their divorce in 1975.</p><img alt="White, Photograph, Monochrome, Snapshot, Black-and-white, Standing, Fun, Monochrome photography, Photography, Family, " title="White, Photograph, Monochrome, Snapshot, Black-and-white, Standing, Fun, Monochrome photography, Photography, Family, " width=1024 height=1016 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/37/1505488538-george-jones-tammy-wynette-la-1973.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Jones and Wynette shopping Nudie\'s Rodeo Tailors in Los Angeles, 1973</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Wynette married two more times, first to businessman Michael Tomlin in 1977 (they split after only 44 days), then, in 1978, to singer-songwriter George Richey, who served as her manager in the 1980s. The union, which lasted until her death in 1998, was an abusive one, according to Wynette's daughter Georgette.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Shortly after they married, Wynette claimed she had been the victim of a kidnapping attempt, and even had a large bruise on her face to prove it.

"There were times when she did want it because she was in pain and he refused to give it to her. She did admit to my sister that when all that stuff came out about her being kidnapped in 1978 that she and Richey had had a fight and he had beaten her. He threatened to destroy her life and write a tell-all book so she decided to stay with him."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Wynette's band and back-up singers became used to covering for her in her later years when she went on stage impaired. "The band even had a saying to clue one another in that Tammy was seriously under the influence: 'Virginia's in the house.' Virginia Pugh was Tammy's real name, and when Virginia's name was invoked, it indicated an overmedicated Wynette," according to the 2010 biography <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010BER07K data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen" data-vars-ga-product-id=f3d01627-58ac-41d6-8a22-dc5d83c2580b data-vars-ga-link-treatment="_t | (not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010BER07K data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010BER07K data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010BER07K data-affiliate-network='{"id":"f2d19a9b-88b2-4e2b-b0f4-2bcc1aef8ac8","site_id":"f30f2c6f-2363-4b03-b482-ae642b94f911","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$948.05 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=3db479b0-bfa8-4733-87fb-9ec61455c517 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Subjects data-optimizely-button-poc=_t class="body-link product-links css-a3mbhf ebsw2pb0">Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen</a> by Jimmy McDonough.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Wynette <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/country-legend-tammy-wynette-dies-in-sleep-19980407 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="died in her sleep" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">died in her sleep</a> at her home in Nashville in 1998.
