I ran down the beach to him, and I would again. You can’t have these three babies and so much of what we had. He’s the love of my life. What am I going to do about that? He’s the most brilliant person in any room, the most charismatic, the most generous. He’s just a complicated guy. I always say, ‘When his sun shines on you, you feel it.’ But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it’s cold. He can cast quite a shadow.”</p><p>MUST-SEE: <a href=#>‘Flip or Flop’ Couple Splits After Seven Years of Marriage</a></p><p>And now, in regard to the couple’s choice to divorce, a source close to the family said, “No matter what happens, Ben and Jen are committed to raising their family as one unit and will continue to do so as it has worked for them.
