ポテンツァとは？ ポテンツァとは、RF（高周波）の熱エネルギーを利用し、にきび跡やにきび、しわ、毛穴の開き、肝斑など様々な肌トラブルの改善を目指す美肌治療機器。韓国で人気を博し、日本でも親しまれるようになってきた。大きく分けて、マイクロニードル（極細針）を使うものと、そうでないものと2パターンの施術がある。
1．マイクロニードルによる治療ポテンツァの施術としてよく知られているのが、マイクロニードルを使った治療。マイクロニードルがたくさん付いた約1センチ四方のチップを、スタンプのように肌に当てて細かな針穴を開けていくことで、肌が本来持っている創傷治癒（＝傷を治す力）を活性化し、コラーゲン生成を促すことで肌を再生させるというのが基本的なメカニズム。
進化系ダーマペンと呼ばれる理由肌に傷をつけ、創傷治癒を生かして肌再生を図るという意味では、ポテンツァとダーマペンは同じような仕組みを持つ。ただし、ダーマペンでは穴を開けるだけなのに対し、ポテンツァでは穴を開けながら熱刺激を加えることが可能に。「針で穴を開ける刺激に加え、熱刺激も加わるため、2つの作用によってさらにコラーゲン生成を促すことができます」と高須先生。
さらにポテンツァは、ダーマペンに比べてダウンタイムも短くて済むように。「ポテンツァでは、熱刺激で毛細血管が焼かれることによる止血効果が期待できます。通常ダーマペンでは1週間ほど顔の赤みがありますが、ポテンツァでは2日〜3日とダウンタイムが半分以下に抑えられるメリットがあります」。
美容成分の注入もできる優れものさらに専用のチップを使えば、薬剤を肌の真皮層へと浸透させることもできる。専用チップは“ポンピングチップ”と呼ばれ、薬剤を導入する施術を“ドラッグデリバリー治療”と呼ぶ。
「成長因子などを注入してあげることによって、創傷治癒との相乗効果でより肌再生を活性化することができます。創傷治癒に薬剤注入と高周波レーザーが加わったポテンツァは、ダーマペンと水光注射、フラクショナルレーザーが一体化したような機械です」。
2．ダイヤモンドチップによる治療マイクロニードルを使わない、痛みを伴わないポテンツァの治療も登場している。最近耳にするようになってきた“ダイヤモンドチップ”は、針のないチップで、RF（高周波）の力だけを使って治療ができるもの。
「RFを流して肌の深部を温めることで、肌再生を促したり、たるみを引き締めたりする効果が期待できます」
痛みなく高周波＋薬剤導入できる高周波を肌の深部に流すという点では、サーマクールなどのRF治療と似た仕組みで、そこまで真新しいものではないが、薬剤を塗布したうえでダイヤモンドチップを使用することで、高周波と同時に薬剤導入できるというのがポイント。
「皮膚にはもともと小さな穴が空いているので、針で穴を開けなくても、薬剤によってはすごく小さな粒子であれば塗るだけでも入っていくことができます。そこに熱を加えてあげることで、血管が開き、さらに浸透しやすくなるというメリットがあります」
肌に傷をつけないため、赤みなどのダウンタイムが一切ないのもダイヤモンドチップのメリットとして挙げられる。
ということで、本来のポテンツァが持っている力を生かすならマイクロニードル（ポンピングチップ）を。とくに大きな肌悩みが現状なく、肌ツヤをレベルアップさせたい場合や、痛みやダウンタイムが気になる場合は、ダイヤモンドチップを選ぶのがよいといえそう。
ポテンツァの特徴 特徴1：様々な肌トラブルに対応ポテンツァの特徴のひとつは、針の長さや熱量を変えることで、様々な肌悩みに対応できること。
「むき卵のようなツルっとした艶肌を目指すこともできますし、くすみを軽減したり、熱の加え方によって肝斑を治したり、毛細血管をあえてしっかり焼いて血管量を減らすことで赤ら顔を治すこともできます」
肌悩みの大きな箇所だけ集中的に治療をしたり、どんな薬剤を注入するかによって様々な目的に対応できるというのもメリットのひとつ。
「脂性肌で、顔全体的に開いた毛穴にお悩みの方には全顔にしっかり当てますし、お顔はキメが細かいながら一部分だけニキビ跡が深い方や、頬の一部だけ毛穴が広がっているような方には、その部分だけ針の長さを長くしたりと工夫しながらそれぞれの肌質に合わせて施術をしていくことができます。そういった意味で今までのマシンに比べてより汎用性が高く、様々なお悩みの治療に使うことができる機械です」
特徴2：ダウンタイムが比較的短い先述のとおり、ポテンツァと同じマイクロニードルを使用するダーマペンに比べて、ダウンタイムが短く済むのもメリットのひとつ。「従来のダーマペンに比べると、赤みがでる期間が半分から半分以下に短くなるというメリットが挙げられます」。
特徴3：痛みがあるぶん効果も大きい針を刺す痛みに加え、熱による火傷のような痛みも合わさるため、どうしても痛みは避けられない。そのぶん効果は大きく、「従来のダーマペンやフラクショナルレーザーを3回やったぐらいの効果が1回で得られるイメージです」と高須先生。
麻酔も従来より進化しており、痛みが気になる場合は、クリーム状の塗る麻酔と吸入による笑気麻酔を併用して、より痛みを緩和できるように。「塗る麻酔をたっぷりと塗って、ゆっくり時間をおきます。さらに笑気麻酔を併用することで、痛みをより感じにくくすることができます」。
ポテンツァは1回でも効果がある？ポテンツァのマイクロニードル治療で最もポピュラーな美肌治療は、ほとんどの場合「1回だけでも効果を感じられる」と高須先生。
「施術後、肌表面に点々としたかさぶたができてザラザラしてきます。5日から6日ほど経つとかさぶたがむけて、まるで卵の薄皮がむけたようにつるんとした肌が出てきます」
継続ケアは半年〜一年に一度が目安ニキビ跡や毛穴の開きなどのお悩みを直すには「3回〜5回を目安に」、クリニックと相談しながら施術を受けるのがよいそう。その後の維持については、半年から一年に1回を目安に継続するのがベストで、自宅でのセルフケアも重要に。
「例えば、クレーターのようにデコボコしたニキビ跡で悩んでいる方が、ポテンツァを3回〜5回受けて凹みを緩和したとしたら、盛り上げた部分はずっとその状態をキープできるといえます。ただし、毛穴はまた皮脂を出そうとして開いてくることがありますし、女性は生理周期によって皮脂の分泌が増えることもあるため、多少戻りを感じることはあると思います。きれいになった後も、半年から一年に1回を目安に継続してあげるのがいいと思います」
ホームケアも重要で、ツヤ肌をキープするためには「手持ちのシートマスクなどを使って保湿をしっかりしてあげると、持続力もアップします」とのこと。
「肌のターンオーバーは年齢などの時間の経過とともに遅くなっていきます。どんなにもともと肌がきれいな方でも、何もしてあげないと老化していきますし、シワもできやすくなります。30代の頃からニキビ跡がコンプレックスで、ポテンツァや肌治療を続けていた方が、50代、60代になったら大逆転で、同世代に比べて若々しく、褒められ肌になったと喜ばれる姿を何度も見てきました。お肌は、お手入れをしてあげるだけ効果があるんです。一度治したからといってケアをしないでおくのはもったいないので、ポテンツァに限らずとも定期的なケアを行ってあげるのがおすすめです」
ポテンツァと組み合わせ可能な薬剤 ポテンツァは、薬剤と同時に組み合わせて使用することで、さらなる効果を得ることができる。薬剤導入が可能なマイクロニードル（ポンピングチップ）で使われる薬剤は、大きく分けて以下の3種類。
薬剤のタイプ1．ジュベルックやマックーム毛穴やニキビ跡のほか、肌のハリ、弾力を求める方におすすめな薬剤がジュベルック（Juvelook）やマックーム（McCoom）。これらは、糸リフトの施術にも使われる、溶ける糸の基本成分（PLLA、ポリ乳酸）を細かくして液体にしたもので、体内に吸収される過程でコラーゲン生成を促す作用を持つ。それによって肌の凹凸をなめらかにし、糸を埋め込んだ時のようなツヤ感を出してくれるというもの。 「厳密には施術の1カ月後くらいから、薬剤による肌のハリツヤ感を感じられるようになります。施術直後に見られるのは、自身が持っている創傷治癒による肌改善です。ちょっと遅れてマックームやジュベルックの働きが出て、コラーゲンが生成されてくるイメージです」
溶ける糸の成分による異物反応は、過剰に密集するとシコリなど副作用の原因にもなるおそれがあるが、ポテンツァは均一に注入することができるのもポイント。
ちなみに韓国でよく聞くジュベルックと、日本でよく使用されるマックームは、原則的に同じ仕組み。どちらも溶ける糸の成分でできており、薬剤メーカーが違うとのこと。
「日本にポテンツァを導入する代理店がメーカー推奨として紹介したのがマックームだったので、日本ではマックームがよく使われるようです。韓国ではもともとジュベルックの方が広く使われていたとのこと。今では日本でもジュベルックを正規代理店から入手できるようになりました」
薬剤のタイプ2．再生医療に近いACRSや高濃度幹細胞培養上清液幹細胞や血小板由来の成分で再生医療に近く、肌質改善から美白まで幅広い肌悩みにアプローチできる薬剤が“ACRS”や“高濃度幹細胞培養上清液”。細胞レベルでエイジングケアを促すこれらのメリットは、創傷治癒を使って治療するポテンツァの仕組みと相乗効果が得やすく、大きな効果を得られることと、ダウンタイムを軽減する可能性があること。「幹細胞由来の成分が持つ抗炎症作用によって、自分で治す力が働いてくるので、しっかり深くまで熱とRFを与えた割には赤みなどのダウンタイムが短くなる傾向にあります」。それぞれの詳細は以下のとおり。
ACRSACRSは、細胞の修復を促す成分（サイトカイン）を自分の血液から抽出して濃縮させたもの。“自己血サイトカインリッチ血清”とも呼ばれ、肌細胞の活性化や若返りを叶えてくれる。
「自分の血液を採って遠心分離機にかけるのですが、試験管の中にガラスビーズという特殊なビーズを入れて、わざと試験管の中で怪我をさせた状態を作り出します。そうすると、怪我をしたと認識した血小板から、傷を治す成分（サイトカイン）が放出されます。体温に近い37度の環境で3時間培養すると完成です。それを、ポテンツァで物理的に怪我をさせた針穴に導入してあげると、より早く傷を治そうという力が働いて、お肌が綺麗になるという仕組みです」
血小板の細胞そのものを直に入れる美容医療として、PRPというものが知られているが、ACRSはこれと似て非なるもので、血小板から出た成分を使用する。PRPは再生医療（第三種）に該当するが、ACRSはこれに該当しない。ACRSは採血して3時間で注入液が完成するので、当日治療も可能。来院したときにまず採血をして、昼食などを食べて3時間後にもう一度来院し、施術を行うこともあるそう。
「細胞を注入するわけではないので、厳密には再生医療には該当しませんが、再生医療に近い仕組みで治療していくというのがACRSです。自己由来の成分で治療したい方に向いている治療です」
高濃度幹細胞培養上清液幹細胞培養上清液とは、幹細胞を培養した際に生じる液体のこと。エクソソームやサイトカインなど、細胞や組織を修復するパワフルな成分が含まれている。
「お腹の脂肪などから幹細胞を採取して培養し、神経損傷や麻痺の方などを治療したり、肌治療などにも応用できる再生医療（第二種）がありますが、その培養液の上澄みの中にも細胞を修復する成分が沢山含まれていることが分かってきたのです。それを注入してあげると、幹細胞ほどではないものの、十分傷を治したり細胞を修復したりする働きがあります」
ACRSは血小板からのサインとかインだけの力なのに対し、こちらは幹細胞由来のさまざまなエクソソームやサイトカインエキスが入っているため、さらに修復能力は強いといえるそう。自分由来のものにこだわらない人や、3時間待つのを避けたい人、採血が苦手な人などに支持されている。
「幹細胞自体が入っていない上澄み液になるので、原則害はありませんが、自己由来のものではないため、今後献血ができなくなる可能性があることに注意してください」
薬剤のタイプ3．シャネル注射などのアミノ酸製剤他によく聞かれるものが、スネコスやシャネル注射（フィルメド注射、フィロルガ注射、NCTF135とも呼ばれる）などの名前で知られるアミノ酸製剤。水光注射などにも使われるこれらの薬剤が、ポテンツァにも使われるようになってきたそう。
仕組みとしてはアミノ酸やヒアルロン酸を入れながら細胞を活性化し、健康な肌を作る肌育治療。全体的に弾力をアップしたり、肌のトーンアップに効果が期待できる。アミノ酸製剤は様々な種類の薬剤が出てきていて、今後さらに伸びていくのでは、と高須先生。

ポテンツァによる最新施術 症例数の多い韓国のクリニックでも注目されているポテンツァの最新施術を2つご紹介。これらは高須クリニックでも施術を受けることができる。
最新施術1．ジュベルックの手打ちコンボひどいニキビ跡に悩む人におすすめなのが、ポテンツァと手打ち注射を併用したスペシャルケア。
「ポテンツァでは針の入る深さには限度がありますが、ポテンツァが入れる深さよりもっと深い ニキビ跡の方もいます。全てポテンツァで治療しようとすると回数もかかるので、手打ち（注射）と併用する患者さんも少なくありません。ポテンツァとジュベルックの手打ちの併用の仕方は、韓国に行って現地の先生に直接教えてもらっているもの。ダイレクトに手打ちするほうが効果があるので、特にくぼんでいる箇所にジュベルックを手打ちで入れてあげると、より早く綺麗にすることができます」。 最新施術2．赤ちゃん肌になれる“ベビーポテンツァ”ベビーポテンツァは、絶妙な温度設定によって、赤ちゃんの肌に多いとされるⅠ型コラーゲン、Ⅲ型コラーゲンの生成を促し、柔らかい肌に仕上げてくれる施術。
「熱を上げすぎないのがポイントで、コラーゲンを壊してしまうほどの強い熱ではなく、ちょうど老化細胞がいなくなるぐらいの温度感覚で、Ⅰ型とⅢ型コラーゲンの生成を誘導してあげるのがベビーポテンツァです。ニキビ跡をしっかり治すような治療ではなく、もともと肌に大きなトラブルはないけれど、もう一段階きれにしたい方や、 肌はきめ細かいのですが小じわが入りやすい方、シワや老化を予防していきたい方にぴったりの治療です」
Ⅰ型、Ⅲ型のコラーゲンを増やす仕組みが解明された比較的新しい研究を応用したもので、国内ではほぼ高須クリニックのオリジナルに近い新しい施術だそう。 ポテンツァがおすすめな人とそうでない人短いダウンタイムで大きな効果を得たい人痛いぶん効果も大きいポテンツァは、比較的短いダウンタイムで、より大きな効果を得たい人におすすめ。痛みと一週間のダウンタイムと引き換えに、むき卵のようなつるんとした肌が手に入るのは大きなメリット。
ニキビ治療＆予防にも化膿している時期以外であれば、ニキビがあっても施術できるのがポイント。ニキビの原因となる皮脂腺を焼いていくため、ニキビ跡の治療をしながら、新しいニキビをできにくくするための予防もできるということ。
「ニキビを完全に治してから、というマシンも多いなかで、治りかけのニキビがある人にも使えるのがポテンツァの長所。新しいニキビができにくくなるというメリットもあるので、ニキビ完治を待たずしてポテンツァを始める方も多いです」</p><footer><a href=../../potenza-skincare-231224-hb.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../duquesne-upsets-byu-for-first-ncaa-tourney-win-in-55-years.html>Duquesne upsets BYU for first NCAA tourney win in 55 years | National</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

但是薑黃素在腸道的吸收利用率並不算高，而黑胡椒中的胡椒鹼，可以有效提升薑黃在人體的利用率，兩種辛香料混和使用還能增強抗氧化效果，讓薑黃和黑胡椒發揮最佳作用，強烈建議搭配一起吃！

In his thought-provoking quote, 'Patience has its limits. Take it too far, and it's cowardice,' George Jackson captures the delicate balance between patience and cowardice. At first glance, this quote reminds us that patience can be a positive quality, allowing us to endure challenges and persevere in the face of adversity. However, it also serves as a cautionary reminder that there is a point beyond which patience can transform into a lack of courage.</p><footer><a href=../../george-jackson-patience-has-its-limits-take-it-too-far-and-its-cowardice.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../katy-perry-interaction-with-orlando-bloom-ex-reveals-insight-into-their-relationship.html>Katy Perry's message to Orlando Bloom's ex reveals revealing glimpse into their relationship</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

<time>01 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div></header><p>龍舌蘭在許多人的認知中是一款酒的名稱，其實，它同時也是製成這種酒的植物原料Agave。這高大的綠色植物外觀酷似巨型的蘆薈，並因其擁有糖分極高的心（Piña，即植物的鱗莖），而被墨西哥人用以製作酒精飲料。
事實上，只要是由龍舌蘭（Agave）百餘種分支植物所製成的酒款，都能稱作龍舌蘭酒，換句話說，龍舌蘭酒泛指了多款不同性質的酒種；而在這當中最為大眾熟悉的，當屬Tequila。
若沒特別說明，龍舌蘭一般指的即是Tequila。
原產於墨西哥的Tequila與其它龍舌蘭酒種相比，受到的法規限制相對嚴格許多；只有以藍色龍舌蘭（Blue Agave）為原料，且於某些特定地區生產的酒款，才有資格被稱為Tequila。
藍色龍舌蘭（Blue Agave）。
龍舌蘭的鱗莖（Piña）。
若你曾嚐過Tequila，但卻未體會到它的美好，那麼，你喝的一定不是100% Agave Tequila！
雖說Tequila必須使用最適合製酒的藍色龍舌蘭，但在比例上，它只需佔發酵糖分的51%即可，剩下49%可以其他農產品替代；而這類不是由100%藍色龍舌蘭發酵的Tequila，也被稱為Mixto，在酒標上，則會特別以Tequila 100% Agave區分出兩者。
為什麼有些Tequila呈透明無色，有些卻是琥珀色？
造成顏色差異的原因，來自於製作過程中，是否經過「陳年」步驟，或有無添加焦糖等調味料。
Tequila屬蒸餾酒，在蒸餾過後酒體會呈透明無色，這時，有些酒廠會直接裝瓶，而有些則會將它倒入橡木桶陳放，讓酒體吸收橡木的色澤而慢慢變深，呈現出淡金甚至是琥珀的顏色，在風味部分也會較沒有經陳年的酒款更複雜濃厚。
另外，也有許多酒款的黃金色澤是因添加了些許的焦糖或橡木萃取液，為的是使它們看起來與經陳年過的酒體相似，喝起來的口感也會柔和許多。
Tequila的最佳飲用法
Tequila＋鹽和檸檬
Tequila最常見的喝法，大概就是與鹽和檸檬一同飲用了。將鹽抹在左手虎口處，並以拇指與食指夾著一片檸檬；先舔上一口鹽，接著迅速喝下以Shot杯盛裝的Tequila，當酒體滑過喉嚨時，馬上將檸檬含在嘴裡，讓鹹味、辣味與酸味在口中交會，合成出舒服協調的特殊風味。
純飲
對100% Agave Tequila來說，純飲即是最佳的喝法，以最簡單純粹的飲用方式，更能品出它帶點微酸的嗆辣口感，或陳年過後的圓潤焦糖香氣。至於該不該加冰塊，其實沒有所謂正確或正統做法，全依你的個人喜好而定。
調製成雞尾酒
以Tequila為基酒調製的雞尾酒亦相當多，舉凡酒吧中最基本的瑪格麗特（Margarita），傳統的帕洛瑪（Paloma），和擁有美麗名字的龍舌蘭日出（Tequila Sunrise）。若你不諳酒性，不妨試試這幾款較平易近人的雞尾酒，一樣能感受Tequila的非凡魅力。
瑪格麗特（Margarita）調酒。
誰說飲酒與減重不能兼得？
對女性來說，Tequila的迷人之處可不僅僅在於它的獨特風味；一項研究指出，龍舌蘭植物含有一種糖類agavin，攝取這種糖後，體內會生成一種叫GLP-1的荷爾蒙，它不但能讓你的飽足感維持更久，還會刺激胰島素分泌，進而降低血糖，對於治療糖尿病患及減輕體重，都有相當的效用。
除此之外，Tequila對身體的益處還有很多，像是能幫助消化、預防老年癡呆等，更棒的是，它不會像其他酒會讓你宿醉，但前提為，你飲用的是100% Agave Tequila。
這些優點或許讓你有了更多喝Tequila的理由，但適度不過度，依舊是品酒的最高原則；切勿因貪杯而傷身，適量小酌即可替微醺的放鬆時刻添味加分！

2014年的《武媚娘傳奇》是由范爺范冰冰主演的宮廷陸劇，由於該劇規模龐大，劇中拍攝場景眾多，人物服裝都十分講究華貴，整體演員的服裝高達3,000套，而范冰冰一人的服裝就有260套，製作成本高達3億人民幣（約台幣13億）。可惜的是播出後評價兩極，雖然收視率不錯，但受到像是與史實不符、了無新意的劇情，甚至服裝太過華麗的批評，因此豆瓣評分只有5.2。

牡羊座3.21-4.19金牛座 4.20-5.20雙子座 5.21-6.21巨蟹座 6.22-7.22獅子座7.23-8.22處女座 8.23-9.22天秤座9.23-10.23天蠍座 10.24-11.21射手座 11.22-12.21魔羯座 12.22-1.19水瓶座1.20-2.18雙魚座 2.19-3.20
牡羊座3.21-4.19挑戰新事物會有成果，並運用「實用資訊」來完善
2024年上半年度，開始進行挑戰的過程會逐漸穩定，迎向第一階段的收穫。許多事情都會上軌道，正是成果可見之時。若開始學習，就試著考證照，而本來因興趣而開始的影音也可以試著收費讓人觀看，嘗試做出「成果」尤為重要。顯現「成果」最明顯的方式就是金錢。增加資產，才能讓心靈及生活都安定下來。而這對工作及人際關係也會產生良好的影響。切忌揮霍或高風險投資，要存錢並做些實際的運用。在工作方面，比起創意等沒有實際型態的內容，朝著能提升業績、粉絲數等實際數據的方向前進，更容易獲得好評。
來到下半年度，人際關係會變得活躍。或許會增加與不曾接觸的人或全新社群之間的交流。這也表示能夠獲得過去所沒有的「資訊」。生存方式、思考方式、生活上的智慧。可能會有種視野豁然開闊的感覺。沒有社群媒體帳號的人，現在正是建立的好時機。因為你也可以是提供「資訊」的其中一人。只有自己不更新而沿用舊方法，就容易產生疏離感，內心也會倍感失落。這段時間不要過度對人抱持超出必要範圍的懷疑。因應之道就是從他人或社群平台上獲得「實用資訊」最為重要。

金牛座 4.20-5.20氣勢上揚的上半年、穩定的下半年 釐清應該做的事
2023的下半年，你便是在對抗如此模糊的世界中逐漸成長。而在進入2024年之後，內心的迷霧總算散去，視野也清晰了起來。自己應該做的事變得清晰明白，可以毫不猶豫地開啟大門。2024上半年度的主題，就是「開啟」。金牛座原本是謹慎派，但也到了在好的方面上向前衝的時候。新企畫、新公司、新戀情、新興趣，一切都隱含著極大的可能性。重點在於切忌謹慎計畫過頭。 2024下半年度，就按著自己的感性行動才能整頓心思，也就能做出冷靜的判斷了。長遠的視角也會油然而生，自己去思考未來人生的相關一切。擁有的渴望會提高也是個很大的特點。會開始追求金錢、不動產、寶石、名牌物品等容易看出價值的東西。盡可能地打造奢華的環境，就能夠提高這個時期的運氣。思考時間比行動時間增加得多，因此糾結或想太多會造成內心疲勞，這種時候就要多看看自我啟發類的書籍。他人的思考及經驗談是一帖良藥，應該可以改善工作或生活的情況。

雙子座 5.21-6.21在迷宮中淬煉自我 迎向最好的幸運期
2023年的雙子座面對極大的變化。全新的道路、變更的路徑、或未來的道路出現分歧……進入2024年之後會彷彿進入迷宮一般，或許覺得所有事情的判斷都變得困難。心情動搖、徬徨、警戒、疲倦的時候也會變多。
而進入2024下半年之後，總算能走出如同沒有終點的迷宮了。正因為經過一段深入的思考，就能一股勁地轉化為行動。因為深思熟慮過後的事情一項一項地開始，這段時期很多事都能順利進行。因此，從5月下旬起到2025上半年度，會進入「每12年一度的幸運時期」。最重要的就是要「督促」自己。自己的想法、價值觀、技術。一切都堅持自我才是最好的。因為這時期有人與你共鳴，為你打氣。工作、創意、展現自我，都是不要想太多就能奏效。

打破框架，轉眼間產生變化的人生
2023年在成功、頭銜、報酬等項目上，是否以肉眼可見的形式達到了某種顛峰呢？即使並非如此，2023年的巨蟹座也品嚐到某些事達成高峰的時刻。或許正因為受到他人關注，才開始去意識到自己在社會中的存在立場。2024年則要從試著直接打破這些事物，重新開始。巨大的變化會以強制性但可令人接受的形式到來。工作方式徹底改變，或是搬家到陌生的地方等，變動幅度越大，情況就會變得越好。不要害怕變化，但如果猶豫裹足不前，就先確認自己基礎穩固並做好準備。擁有穩固的基礎或信念，變化才能夠成立。心境也會產生變化。被原有的作法、傳統束縛住，會讓心靈枯竭。順應對變化的渴望才會更健康。
到了下半年，或許會對上半年度的變化感到猶疑不定。那些變化到了2025年會成為龐大的養分，所以最好認清這段時間就是無法避免的過渡期。此外，這時期既可以培養仰賴他人的能力，也能產生利用周遭事物的力量。這段時期若打算獨自解決問題，效率就不會太好。要聰明地善用他人的力量，建立回饋給自己的方式，這樣所有事情才會輕鬆許多。

獅子座7.23-8.22
經過成功之後的迷惘 下半年迎來人生的轉捩點
2023年你隨心所欲地行動，讓眼中的世界變得更寬闊。應該已經看見了各式各樣的生活方式、思考模式，接受許多刺激。「局面正在有所改變」——你將會在滿心興奮積極的狀態下，來到2024年。上半年之內，這種興奮會伴隨著實際成果而化為滿足感。這正是所謂「開花結果」的時期。任職一直想坐上的崗位、得到期待中的報酬，達到訂定好的目標。這些成功正等著你，取得的成績能夠獲得好評或一口氣提升跳槽時的價值，說不定還會有人來挖角。所謂成功，也意味著被賦予了力量。以名留青史的決心去採取行動吧。
2024下半年的主題就是「改變方針」。改變工作、改變方法、改變社群。若發現上半年持續的趨勢開始出現停滯的狀況時，就是下定決心的時候到了。重要的是去考量人生這個長遠的規劃，人生的目的為何，現在要先試著去面對。

2023年的處女座具備了能專注於特定事物的環境。這時期應該已經學習到一些專業或特殊能力，準備要往下一個階段邁進了。另一方面，可能會有些人碰上超出預期的事件而感到迷惘。然而因「失去」而愕然的時間已經過去，接下來要進入「拿回來」的階段。2024上半年會開始追求類似「人生的目的是什麼？」或「自己是因何而生？」等哲學層次的問題。契機或許就是2023年體會到的衝擊事件吧。為了獲得滿意的答案，接觸各式各樣的人、文化就很重要。出國旅遊也是不錯的方式。因為接受了多元的內容而拓展視野，工作或興趣等所有面向上的幅度也會大增，擴大自己的世界。這樣就會產生積極性，並化為行動。
來到2024下半年，就能看見上半年一直在追求的答案。自己應該做的事，還有長期願景都會變得清晰明確。幸運的是你已經具備了能具體實踐的能力與環境。但在這個過程中，可能會被迫做出一些取捨的選擇。即使放手偏愛的事物或捨不得的工作，也應該要迎向全新的情境。此外，下半年也是有機會解決執念的時期。試著積極去處理讓你難受、不擅長的事。
