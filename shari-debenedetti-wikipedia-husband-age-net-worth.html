And Halloween will the auspicious (maybe ominous would be the right word here) occasion to kick things over. The show will be returning with its core cast of Jason Hawes, Steve Gonsalves, Dave Tango, and Shari DeBenedetti.</p><p>Sharon DeBenedetti has earned her name as one of the best paranormal investigators and a very charming reality show star.</p><p>If you want to know more about the woman who set herself among wacky men and spooky ghosts and was able to establish herself as a force to be reckoned with, read along.</p><h3><strong>Shari Debenedetti On Ghost Hunters</strong></h3><p>Shari first appeared on Ghost Hunters in November 2015. It was the 11th episode of the 2015 season (215th episode overall) and was named Innocent Until Proven Dead.</p><p>Shari, who was then credited as Shari Ventura, appeared as a guest investigator and then continued to appear as a guest investigator for the next two episodes before the conclusion of the season.</p><p>And then, she became a regular cast member in the 2016 season and appeared on all 13 episodes of the season.</p><p>The series went on a minor hiatus between 2016 and 2019. And Shari did not reappear on the 2019 or 2020 seasons. However, she has returned once more for the 2021 season.</p><p>The 2021 season started with a “special Halloween event” on 31 October 2021. The teaser of the new season came out a little while ago. And it starts with the statement, “Over 15 years investigating together has led to this moment.”</p><p>Apart from the four core members (Jason, Steve, Dave, and Shari), the show will also feature guests like Amy Bruni, Adam Berry, and many others.</p><p>The new season will be available on Discovery+.</p><h3><strong>Shari Debenedetti Husband</strong></h3><p>We do not know anything about Shari DeBenedetti’s husband apart from the fact that his surname was Ventura. And we only know that because Shari chose to not use her married name (which is Shari Ventura) and use his maiden name instead.</p><p>Shari has mentioned her son a few times on her social media though. In 2016, she had a Tweet saying that her son had turned 11 years old.</p><p>Then there were a few Instagram posts in 2017. In one post, her son was doing “a little investigating”. And in the other, her son met Kane and got him to sign his mask.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Shari Debenedetti?</strong></h3><p>Shari DeBenedetti was born on 26 August 1973. That means, as of 1 November 2021, she was 48 years old. And her zodiac sign was Virgo.</p><h3><strong>Shari Debenedetti Career</strong></h3><p>Shari is a professional paranormal investigator. And she has been one for almost 25 years.</p><p>It all started because Shari was living in a haunted house. She used to hear footsteps, knocks, voices. At one point, she was held down in bed. And once, a full-body apparition appeared in her room.</p><p>At first, Shari started to investigate to solve her problem. Then she started to help other people who were having similar problems. And while she was doing that, she met Jason Hawes and his TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society) team.</p><p>Shari did off-camera work for TAPS for years before she finally appeared with Jason and TAPS in Ghost Hunters season 10 (2015). Apart from Ghost Hunters, Shari has also appeared on Travel Channel’s paranormal reality series called Ghost Nation.</p><p>In 2018, Shari also acted in a movie called Red Army Hooligans.</p><p>During an interview, when asked about her end goal when she gets a paranormal report, Shari said “I want to teach our clients everything I know and that I’ve experienced, and I want them to realize that these things might happen”.</p><p>Long before reality shows and fame and everything, Shari was doing private investigations and working her regular job. She was and still is, a real estate agent. In the past, she has also worked as Leads Coordinator for Weston & Sampson, and as an Executive Assistant for International Aquatic Design, Inc.</p><h3><strong>Shari Debenedetti Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Shari DeBenedetti’s net worth, as of 2021, was estimated to be around $600 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Shari Debenedetti?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Quite tall.
