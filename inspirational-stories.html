And that's especially true when it comes to family lore. &nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">With her syrupy sweet accent, my grandmother, who grew up in Pascagoula, Mississippi, had stories that were as drawn out and rich as molasses. One favorite was the time her baby brother JB caught an alligator and left it in the bathtub. As she remembers it, after it scared the bejesus out of their mother, the alligator chewed up a new broom, tore a hole in the sun porch, and trundled off toward the water.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">After my grandmother passed away last year, the family all went down to her birthplace in Mississippi to scatter her and my grandfather's ashes. Her alligator-catching&nbsp;brother, JB Morgan, still lives there with his wife Sandra, who gave us a tour of the house, pausing in the bedroom to show us a sepia-toned vintage photograph.</p><img alt="Sitting, Picture frame, Art, Vintage clothing, Knee, Interior design, Artwork, Visual arts, Rectangle, Painting, " title="Sitting, Picture frame, Art, Vintage clothing, Knee, Interior design, Artwork, Visual arts, Rectangle, Painting, " width=2448 height=3264 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/16/11/1458311979-unknown-2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Alden Wicker</span><p>The author\'s aunt as a little girl.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Inside a 16x20 frame, a little girl looks coyly at the camera, a telephone held to her ear. She wears a polka-dot dress with puffy sleeves and a collar, and her blond curls are piled on top of her head and finished with a ribbon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"That's me," Sandra told us. "Look familiar? It looks just like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunbeam_Bread data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Little Miss Sunbeam" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Little Miss Sunbeam</a>!" Indeed it does. And Sandra had a theory that Little Miss Sunbeam was inspired by her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">In July of 1948, Sandra was a three-year-old girl living in Columbia, Mississippi. Her mother, aunt, and two uncles worked at the McVaden photography studio in nearby Biloxi, Mississippi, and conspired to get a ladylike portrait of tomboy Sandra. Her mother&nbsp;curled her hair, put her in a dress her grandmother made, and made Sandra sit for her uncle,&nbsp;Dan C. Harbison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"I didn't like him," Sandra, now 70 years old, says. "He scared me. He had this really deep voice, was a bit gruff. When he would come near me, I would cry. Finally, on the final day of the three days, he managed to get a couple good pictures."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Harbison chose the one of her coyly holding the phone to color with oils, a popular method at that time. (All the other versions of the photo have been lost to Hurricane Katrina.) Around the same time, Sunbeam bread became popular, and her family started calling Sandra Little Miss Sunbeam.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.qba.com/miss_sunbeam.asp data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Quality Bakers of America" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Quality Bakers of America</a>, the bakery cooperative that owns the Sunbeam trademark, says that the identity of the&nbsp;girl who inspired the Miss Sunbeam logo is a mystery. Illustrator Ellen B. Segner saw a little blond girl playing in New York City's&nbsp;Washington Park, and sketched her over several days, creating the&nbsp;logo that appears on the&nbsp;Sunbeam&nbsp;bread wrapper&nbsp;to this day. The original oil painting created by Ms. Segner hangs in Quality Bakers of America's office in Pennsylvania.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But Sandra thought that this story might be a fabrication. At the urging of a friend, she did some preliminary research online in the early 2000s after the illustrator Segner passed away. Her first piece of evidence was that the logo first appeared on a billboard in 1950, according to Wikipedia. And then there was the fact that her Uncle Dan brought the painted portrait of Sandra to the National Photographers&nbsp;Convention in Chicago in 1948, where Sandra says he won first place in the category of hand-colored portrait photographs of children. Perhaps Segner was inspired by the adorable winning portrait but couldn't admit it, so she made up the park story?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"Everyone who has ever seen the photo has said, 'That looks like Little Miss Sunbeam,'" Sandra says. "What is striking to me is the expression on the child, the ribbons, the hair, and the puffy dress. That was an iconic Southern little girl's dress. My mother had to spend an hour to fix my hair," Sandra says. She would have much rather been outside playing baseball then sitting for a portrait in a dress, and can't imagine putting that much time and work into dressing a little girl for the park three days in a row. "I don't think little girls&nbsp;playing in a park in New York in the '40s would have been wearing that! Doesn't make sense to me. That's when I started telling my family, 'Hey, maybe I am Little Miss Sunbeam!'"</p><img alt="Finger, Hairstyle, Style, Art, Electric blue, Hair accessory, Headpiece, Thumb, Pleased, Blond, " title="Finger, Hairstyle, Style, Art, Electric blue, Hair accessory, Headpiece, Thumb, Pleased, Blond, " width=538 height=640 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/16/11/1458315849-2152206-misssunbeam.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Quality Bakers of America</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">I was intrigued. What if the portrait really was Segner's inspiration? What if, similar to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.wired.com/2011/01/hope-image-flap/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='Shepard Fairey&#39;s Obama "Hope" poster' class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Shepard Fairey's Obama "Hope" poster</a>, which was lifted from an Associated Press photo, the estate of Harbison deserved remuneration? Sandra gave me her blessing to find out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">First, I tried to verify that her uncle won the contest. According to the diligent research performed by librarians at the Chicago Public Library (did you know that librarians will do research for you for free?!) there was indeed a Photographer's Association of America Convention in Chicago in August of 1948. Unfortunately, the Association's magazine, in its significant coverage of the convention gave no mention of who won each contest category. Jenny from the Biloxi Public Library told me that the local Biloxi newspaper mentioned that Harbison attended the convention, but didn't mention him winning.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Next, I pursued Sandra's idea&nbsp;that perhaps it might be out of the ordinary for a little girl with blond curls and a party dress to go prancing through the urban&nbsp;park in front of Ms.&nbsp;Segner. It seemed to be a plausible hypothesis. Tenements, which housed a variety of striving immigrants, were a well-known feature of downtown New York City at the time. I found <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.1940snewyork.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1940s New York" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">1940s New York</a>, a project by City University of New York. It scanned and put online a four-newspaper collaborative project from 1943 called New York City Market Analysis into a clickable map by neighborhood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Some of "the most expensive type of modern hotels and apartment houses,"&nbsp;the paper said, were situated just north of the park on Fifth Avenue. Families in this neighborhood paid more than $150 a month in rent (about $2,530 today), and their annual expenditure was estimated to be more than $10,000 a year ($168,000 in today's dollars.) This may not seem impressive compared to rental prices today for Greenwich Village, but at the time, the newspaper asserted that, "Prosperity blooms along Fifth Avenue north of Washington Square. Business couples like this neighborhood." So perhaps a&nbsp;little girl in a fancy dress&nbsp;actually was playing in the park that day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But how Southern was Little Miss Sunbeam's dress, anyway? A quick eBay search&nbsp;yielded a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.ebay.com/itm/One-Vintage-40s-Finely-Constructed-Blue-White-Plaid-Cotton-Girls-Dress-/291697528489?hash=item43ea870ea9:g:YasAAOSwpDdU-c3A" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vintage 1940s girl's dress for sale" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">vintage 1940s girl's dress for sale</a>, with blue and white plaid fabric, puffy sleeves, and a white bib. Perfect for Miss Sunbeam. When I researched vintage children's sewing patterns, I found that little girls' dresses scarcely changed in style from the '30s through the '70s. They all had puffy sleeves and collars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">All the while, I was trying to get in touch with the president of Quality Bakers of America. When I finally got him on the phone, he spoke in a comforting, low, raspy voice—the exact kind of voice you would expect to hear from the president of a vintage Americana, white-bread brand.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"Your aunt is not Miss Sunbeam,"&nbsp;he told me in no uncertain terms.&nbsp;He reiterated that the brand was most definitely first marketed with the logo in 1942 in Delaware—before my aunt was even born.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"We get inquiries every month," he says.&nbsp;"It will happen that someone's mother or grandmother will pass away, and&nbsp;people will inquire, 'Where are the royalty checks? My grandmother was Miss Sunbeam.'" He estimates there were 50 to 100 winners of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://articles.mcall.com/1984-01-15/news/2409982_1_amelia-earhart-ballots-blue-eyes data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Little Miss Sunbeam contests" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Little Miss Sunbeam contests</a> across the country. "We always respond that maybe they won a contest, but they were not the original Miss Sunbeam."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Aunt Sandra may not have been Miss Sunbeam, but the story says more about her family life than it does about royalty checks. And there is infinitely more value in that.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-fkadry eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">I verified&nbsp;this assertion by searching on eBay and Etsy, where I found several examples of vintage Sunbeam bread wrappers decorated with the little blond girl, clearly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etsy.com/listing/190008092/waaay-cool-vintage-1942-miss-sunbeam data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dated 1942" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">dated 1942</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">And so, that was the end of my search. We may never actually know the name of the little girl who inspired the Little Miss Sunbeam logo. She would be about 78 years old by now, and may not even remember walking through Washington Square Park, her&nbsp;hair curled and beribboned.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">I almost feel bad for coming in with my hard nose for facts and ruining my aunt's quaint&nbsp;Southern story. It always happens that way with my family. I was told a county in Virginia was named after my family, but some quick research in college revealed that this was a fabrication.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">As for that alligator, JB says it didn't meander away to the water, but ended up in a ditch in front of Ms. Cobb's house, and the police came to take care of it. It was apparently a big to-do. Who is correct? Does it even matter? The joy in these stories isn't in the facts, but in the telling. It's in visiting with family and sitting with them on the porch with sweet tea, hearing them take their time to savor an old family story. Aunt Sandra may not have been Miss Sunbeam, but the story says more about her and her family life than it does about royalty checks. And there is infinitely more value in that.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6ipayomaeutbXOp5ilZaOpvLO1xKxmp52nqHyif5ZybXBno6q7o7HApmSbqpWWsW6zyKujaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finspirational-stories.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finspirational-stories.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finspirational-stories.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finspirational-stories.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finspirational-stories.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finspirational-stories.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-earth-healthy-son-drop-dead-without-warning-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-earth-healthy-son-drop-dead-without-warning-html.html>How on earth could my healthy son drop dead without warning?'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./starbucks-wins-2-3-billion-in-free-advertisement-from-game-of-thrones-gaffe-as-emilia-clarke-attempts-to-distance-herself.html>Starbucks Got $2.3 Billion in Free Advertisement From 'Game Of Thrones' Gaffe -- Emilia Clarke Attem</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./starbucks-wins-2-3-billion-in-free-advertisement-from-game-of-thrones-gaffe-as-emilia-clarke-attempts-to-distance-herself.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
