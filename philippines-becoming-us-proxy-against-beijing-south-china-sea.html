Packed with US ships, aircraft and troops, they also stored nuclear weapons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Successive administrations in Manila defined their nationalism by either supporting or opposing the bases, though in private all supported them for “protecting” the Philippines from communist aggression.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, which coincided with a volcanic eruption that covered the bases in ash and the Philippines’ refusal to renew leases on both following a dispute over rent, led to the US abandoning them a year later.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Circumstances have changed in the decades since. In December, the Philippines’ House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea, as Manila calls the parts of the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone, and calling on the government to continue asserting its rights.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Philippine military races for sea change amid China’s rising maritime threat</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the country’s defence budget remains low compared to its neighbours. Last year, Manila spent just over US$7 billion on its military, less than Malaysia’s US$8.9 billion, Singapore’s US$17 billion, Indonesia’s US$18 billion – and far behind the US$377 billion China reportedly spent.</p>The Philippines is slowly <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">modernising its military</span></a>.

It currently has no submarines.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are going for interoperability,” Colonel Logico said. “We are trying to see, if we go to war, are our … soldiers familiar with the capabilities of our treaty allies?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“To work together we need to have the same terminologies, appreciation of the operational environment,” he added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘The ants that get trampled on’</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not everyone agrees with drawing closer to the US, however, and they warn about the Philippines turning into a “proxy” for American interests. The president’s own sister Imee, a senator, told ANC Digital earlier this month that “China will always be our neighbour, we have no fight with them, let’s not get dragged into a fight that’s not our own.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Anna Rosario Malindog-Uy, director of the pro-China Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, wrote in the Manila Times on February 10 that “agreements such as the EDCA, the VFA and the Mutual Defence Treaty have not only cemented the US military presence and influence in the Philippines but also, most importantly, exemplified the Philippines’ dependence on the US in the military and defence sector.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teresita Ang See, former president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies and currently part of its advisory council, told This Week in Asia: “Filipinos in general condemn China’s action.

I will always see things from the realist perspective,” Logico said. “I’m aware of the Thucydides trap – the idea that a rising power will eventually collide with an existing power. And one way to avoid this is through deterrence … discouraging the other party from making any overt acts that will take aggression a step further.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The idea that China could displace the US as the Philippines’ main ally had crossed his mind during the Duterte administration, he revealed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There was a time when I really thought it would happen. But China committed one strategic error. They did not deliver what they promised,” Logico said.</p>After a state visit to Beijing <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">in 2016</span></a>, Duterte said China had promised the Philippines US$24 billion worth of investments, aid and loans. But by 2021 only US$3.2 billion worth of investments had been recorded by Manila’s National Economic Development Authority, in addition to two bridges for the capital costing 4.8 billion pesos (US$85.6 million) that Beijing donated.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/06/clear-thumb.jpg>Before Duterte left office in June 2022, all remaining loans that were still under negotiation had been cancelled, including <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">for three key rail projects</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Duterte’s was “the most China-friendly administration the Philippines has seen”, said the Filipino defence analyst who declined to be identified. But during his six years in power “China actually delivered quite little”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The shift away from Duterte’s pro-China stance has met with little resistance as most Filipinos are traditionally pro-American. Millions of Filipino-Americans live in the United States and it remains a popular goal to emigrate to the country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In fact, a 2014 survey by the Pew Research Centre’s Global Attitudes Project found that 85 per cent of Filipinos had favourable views of the US – compared to just 84 per cent of Americans.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Philippines’ US ties risk more than links with China, expert warns</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A more recent poll conducted by survey firm Pulse Asia, whose findings were published last month, showed that eight in 10 Filipinos wanted their country to work with the US – as well as Australia, Japan, Canada and Britain – to resolve the South China Sea issue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Only one in 10 said they would prefer to work with China. In the same survey, 67 per cent of respondents said they believed in the need to strengthen the Philippines’ external defence capability, especially its navy, air force and coastguard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In terms of its organisation, training, equipment and traditions, the Philippines’ military has long imitated that of the US.</p>Even Duterte observed as much in June 2017, telling reporters after seeing the close cooperation between Filipino and US soldiers during the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">retaking of Marawi City</span></a> from Islamist militants: “This is really the sentiment of our soldiers.

That’s why they have this rapport and I cannot deny that”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By contrast, the first time any Filipino officer studied in Beijing was during the Duterte administration’s pivot to China when a handful were sent there as part of an exchange programme, according to military sources who asked not to be named.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, even religious officials have, in effect, given their blessing to the current government’s efforts to seek allies against China. In a “joint pastoral exhortation” dated February 8, six bishops from the Philippines’ Catholic Church stated: “It is no secret that the aggressive incursions of the Chinese into our maritime zones” had resulted in the destruction of maritime resources and “wrought havoc on the lives of our fisherfolk”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bishops, coming from areas with fishing communities, said that in the absence of effective diplomacy, “then it is permissible – morally necessary even – to have recourse to the friendship of allies who can help us defend what is ours”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘A third world war is possible’</h3>The real danger lies in escalation. The Philippines maintains that its military alliance with the US, and partnerships with other countries <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">such as Japan</span></a>, are defensive in nature. Beijing sees it as part of a pattern of encirclement.China has already used water cannons and other aggressive tactics against Philippine vessels. What might come next is unknown. The language has also become more heated. Beijing has said it would oppose “illegal construction”, referring to Manila’s plans <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">to upgrade outposts on islands and reefs it controls</span></a>.
