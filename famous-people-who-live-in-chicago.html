The Art Institute of Chicago holds the largest collection of Impressionist paintings outside the Louvre in Paris.</p><p>Chicago’s average elevation is 594 feet (181 meters) above sea level. The city is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of Lake Michigan.</p><p>The name ”Chicago” comes from the Algonquin word “Shikaakwa” or “Chicagou” which translates to “wild garlic” or “onion field.” Downtown Chicago is known as “the Loop,” referencing the shadow the elevated train tracks create in the area.</p><p>Chicago’s 58 million domestic and international visitors in 2018 made it the 2nd most visited city in the US, behind New York City’s around 65 million visitors. The first televised U.S. presidential candidates’ debate was broadcast from Chicago’s CBS Studios on September 26, 1960, between Richard Milhous Nixon and John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</p><h2><strong>List Of 12 Famous People Who Live (Or Lived) In Chicago:</strong></h2><h2><strong>#1 Harrison Ford</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-36345 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harrison-Ford-green-eyes.jpg.webp alt="Harrison Ford green eyes" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harrison-Ford-green-eyes.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36345 class=wp-caption-text>© Guliver / Getty Images</p><p>He is an American actor who gained worldwide fame for his starring roles as the title character of Indiana Jones (an American media franchise based on the adventures of Dr. Henry Walton “Indiana” Jones, Jr.) movie series and as Han Solo in the Star Wars film series.</p><p>In 1985, Ford received an Academy Award nomination for his work in Witness, a crime drama directed by Peter Weir and co-starring Kelly McGillis.
