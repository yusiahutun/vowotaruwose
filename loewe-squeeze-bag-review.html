If you follow celebrities like Kendall Jenner, Sofia Richie, Emily Ratajkowski, Alexa Chung, or Jennifer Lawrence (to just name a few), the Loewe Squeeze Bag has probably already made it onto your feed. Will Kendall Jenner do a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Loewe Squeeze Bag review</a>? I doubt it—but I certainly will. Since the bag is on a trial loan from Loewe’s PR department, I did not personally shell out thousands of dollars for the bag. Instead, I got to spend one singular day with the sold-out style. I present to you, a day in the life of an It Bag: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Loewe Squeeze Bag edition</a>.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.511749347258><h2>The Subject</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Loewe-clp-F23-079.jpg><p>Before we get the squeeze on The Squeeze IRL, let’s lay out the bag’s credentials.&nbsp;</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Squeeze Bag </a>is a part of Loewe’s Fall/Winter ‘23 collection. It is made with soft, buttery lambskin leather and gets its namesake from its squishy squeeze handle. The bag hangs on a gold donut-style chain which can be adjusted to carry the bag crossbody, as a shoulder bag, or as a handheld accessory. Color choices include oat, olive, black, and burgundy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-31-at-1.14.06-PM.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The bag’s</a> lightweight, spacious single-pocket body and versatility can be used to justify the $4,450 investment for the medium size or the $3,950 investment for the small.</p><p>If you’ve already decided that you’d like to add the Loewe Squeeze Bag to your collection, you may have to wait a bit to acquire it. The bag is currently sold out on Loewe’s site in both small and medium sizes. As someone who has searched for a sold-out Loewe bag before, I’d recommend stopping by a store in person if possible, and becoming best friends with a sales associate. They can add you to a contact list if a bag gets re-stocked in-store.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.89270386266094><h2>Credentials</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1673288573.jpg><p>The Squeeze Bag is already quite the street style star. Fashion influencers like Aimee Song and Emili Sindlev have posted photos with the bag and it was a top choice amongst the stylish squad at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Fashion Week in September</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.318093385214><h2><span><span>A Day In The Life: The Morning</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2023_10_19-09_43_32_8780_A9B1D70D.jpg><p>The Loewe Squeeze Bag and I started the day by going for a morning coffee walk. While other Squeeze Bags may have owners who get their morning coffee delivered via an assistant, I must acquire my coffee myself. This is how I start each and every day so if a bag is going to find a permanent home in my closet, it has to be an excellent companion for my morning routine.</p><p>Since this was my first-ever outing with the coveted accessory, I wanted to make sure my outfit was doing it justice, even if it was a bit casual.</p><p>I paired the bag with an oversized quilted jacket in a shade similar to coffee creamer. The jacket felt casual, chic, and even a little bit sporty. I loved the way the oat leather of the Squeeze Bag paired with the cream shade of my jacket and was able to walk the .7 miles to my coffee shop of choice without the strap slipping off of my shoulder.</p><p>Since I was having a Loewe moment, I thought <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">my Loewe Flow sneakers</a> would be the perfect match. A little brand loyalty never hurts.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7><h2>A Day In The Life: The Work Day</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1485.jpg><p>Since my job as a writer and content creator is remote, I don’t have to dress within the usual confines of workwear. I do, however, need a work tote that will go everywhere I go. At any given moment, I’m carrying a camera, collapsible tripod, laptop, and at least two different lip products. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Squeeze Bag fit my tripod and my other necessities. Did I just meet my dream coworker?</p><p>I spent the first half of my day enjoying unusually warm fall weather and working from the coffee shop’s outdoor seating. I propped the Loewe bag up on the table so I could lovingly gaze at it as I wrote emails. Staring at the bag throughout my workday made me reconsider my writing career. As I calculated the average CPW (in this case, cost per wear) in my head if I were to wear the bag every day for the rest of my life, I decided I may have been better served with a career in finance. I’m kidding, kind of.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.7085271317829><h2>A Day In The Life: The Evening</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2023_10_19-17_10_49_3630_0D6444BE.jpg><p>Like any regular person in possession of a sold-out item, I was eager to show it off. Luckily, I had two work events in the evening which meant that I could nonchalantly wear the Squeeze Bag in front of other fashion industry professionals. The events were relatively casual and as I previously noted, the fall weather was unusually warm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-31-at-12.39.59-PM.png><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>A patterned sweater</a> from Finnish design brand, Marimekko, seemed like the perfect pick. I thought the quirky floral pattern of my sweater complemented the fabulous shape of the squeeze handle and donut chain on the bag.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.527868852459><h2>A Day In The Life: Events</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2023_10_19-17_21_48_5550_64484D6A.jpeg><p>I paired the sweater with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">my beloved Tibi jeans</a> (seriously, you’ll see me wear them at least four times a week) and brown Miu Miu penny loafers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-31-at-12.44.59-PM.png><p>The wide barrel leg shape of the denim is my favorite and you can find more affordable versions of the silhouette from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">brands like Free People</a>.</p><p>I purposefully wore my hair in a ponytail to show off the strap of the bag.&nbsp;</p><p>Within a few minutes of arriving at my event, I was approached about my bag. It turns out that a great accessory can instantly increase personal popularity. I thanked everyone who complimented me on the Loewe Squeeze and did not dare inform them that I had to send it back the next day.</p><p>I’m a firm believer that my outfit can transform the way I feel on the inside. Even though I may not be a celebrity (yet), the bag truly made me feel like I had celeb status.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>In Conclusion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1576.jpg><p>The Loewe Squeeze Bag exceeded my expectations (which were honestly pretty high to begin with). I often feel like I have to choose between wearing a fashionable bag and a functional bag and Loewe managed to check both boxes. While the price of the bag is high, the style is still less expensive than a smaller bag you could buy from a brand like Chanel. I prefer this style because the shape is unique but also isn’t so trendy that it will go out of style.</p><p>I’ve officially added The Loewe Squeeze Bag to my personal wishlist and have turned on alerts for a restock on Loewe’s site. Now if only it would go on sale…</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfobymw8RmqqqtlZrHpnnBmp5mqpWrtqbDjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2floewe-squeeze-bag-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2floewe-squeeze-bag-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2floewe-squeeze-bag-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2floewe-squeeze-bag-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2floewe-squeeze-bag-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2floewe-squeeze-bag-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./66175eedca4741254d8b4572-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./66175eedca4741254d8b4572-html.html>NBA: El enigma de Zach Edey, el coloso de 2,24 que juega como &amp;quot;un alce&amp;quot;: la NBA espera a un pvot j</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./slicked-back-bun-8404015.html>How to Style a Slicked-Back Bun on Every Hair Type</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./slicked-back-bun-8404015.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
