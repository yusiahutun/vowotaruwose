<time>30 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Written in partnership with RMS Titanic, Inc.</p><p>It has been 110 years since the all-too-short life and sudden loss of the RMS Titanic, and 37 years since the discovery of this great Ship and the reintroduction of the legend to the modern world.</p><p>Here are some highlights of the progress made over the years to recover artifacts and the latest discoveries surrounding the RMS Titanic. If you’re looking for even, deeper exploration including never before seen video, additional hidden treasures and more, visit <a href=#>discovertitanic.com</a>.</p><h2 class=p6>The Sinking</h2><p>On April 15th, 1912, at 2:20 in the morning, Titanic slipped beneath the surface of the North Atlantic and fell almost 2.5 miles to the ocean floor. Light cannot reach this inhospitable depth; the cold is inescapable (hovering around 33°-34° F) and Titanic became home to numerous deep-sea creatures — some so tiny that they could only be seen under a microscope. For decades, many expected to find the Ship intact and in one piece in its final resting place at the bottom of the ocean. Books were written, movies were made — but the only way to know was to find what was lost. The world was in store for a shock that changed history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Underwater-Bow.jpg><h2 class=p6>The Great Discovery</h2><p class=p1>September 1st, 1985: A expedition of American and French oceanographers set out to find the great Ship. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea (IFREMER) were using side-scan sonar and underwater camera systems from the research vessels Le Suroit and Knorr to scan the ocean floor in search of Titanic. It was about 2:00am when William Lange, world-renowned expert in underwater imaging, camera system design, and underwater surveying, saw something on the monitor lying on the ocean floor. He recognized it to be a boiler and drew a breath. This wasn’t just any boiler — it was from Titanic. Just at the beginning of his career, he was the first person in 73 years to see and recognize the RMS Titanic wreck site.</p><p class=p1>The legendary Ship was found, broken in two, 13 miles from the last recorded position and about 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. Two years later, in 1987, RMS Titanic, Inc. made its first dive to explore the wreck site and recover artifacts, and in 1994 became the official and legal Salvor-In-Possession of the RMS Titanic and wreck site.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/underwater_tub.jpg><h2 class=p10>RMS Titanic, Inc. — Expedition Titanic: 2010 & The Ongoing Oversight</h2><p class=p1>Twenty-five years after Titanic was discovered, RMS Titanic, Inc. conducted Expedition Titanic 2010, a ground-breaking expedition that brought together a team of leading archaeologists, oceanographers, scientists, and technicians to produce the first comprehensive map of the entire Titanic wreck site using revolutionary acoustic and optical underwater imaging technologies, including 3-D photogrammetric imaging. This first-time mapping of the entire site provides RMSTI scientists and researchers with a base map for all future RMS Titanic, Inc. research to build upon. This on-going research at the wreck site is a crucial and important part of RMSTI’s stewardship of the wreck site and the preservation of the legacy of Titanic&nbsp;and the stories of those who experienced that fateful night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/William-Lange.jpg><h2 class=p6>The Artifacts</h2><p>In addition to Expedition Titanic 2010, since 1987, RMS Titanic, Inc. through joint French, American, and Russian expeditions, has made seven research and recovery dives to Titanic’s wreck site and recovered over 5,500 artifacts to date. Every artifact recovered tells a story; here are just a few of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Last-Photo.jpg><h3 class=p7>1987: THE CHERUB</h3><p class=p8>Originally gilded, this bronze statue resembles a rosy-cheeked, plump child (or wingless cherub) which was a popular decorative element in Edwardian England. It held an electrically illuminated torch (now absent), held aloft in both hands. Much smaller than the larger cherubs of the Grand Staircase, it is thought to be a light fixture from a side post newel on the aft staircase on C Deck which was destroyed when the Ship tore apart.</p><h3 class=p7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cherub.jpg></h3><h3 class=p7>1993: TWO HALVES OF A CLARINET</h3><p class=p8>Howard Irwin and Henry Sutehall, two young carriage upholsterers from Buffalo, NY set out to travel the world. While on their adventure, Howard played this clarinet (which he carried in a large leather trunk along with his reeds, tools, sheet music, and postcards.) On April 10th, Henry boarded Titanic; Howard did not, yet somehow Howard’s trunk made it on the Ship. His clarinet and trunk were recovered 81 years later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Clarinet.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Clarinet-2.jpg><h3 class=p7>1994: BOLLARDS</h3><p class=p8>Bollards are massive posts that were used to tie Titanic to a pier using 4” thick ropes. These bollards, originally located at the stern (back) on the Third Class Poop Deck, broke off and were later recovered from the seabed. Made of cast iron, they were cleaned, desalinated, and stabilized to preserve them. The process took over two years. They weight about 5,000 pounds, which is about the same weight as a walrus or a BMW X5 SAV!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bollards.jpg><h3 class=p7>1996: MAIN ENGINE ROOM TELEGRAPH</h3><p class=p8>One of two telegraphs that once stood on Titanic’s&nbsp;bridge, these were used to relay engine speed or stop commands to the Engine Room. As soon as Officer William McMaster Murdoch received the ice warning from the Crow’s Nest, he threw the handles to “All Astern” to signal the engine room crew to reverse the engines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Telegraph.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Telegraph-1.jpg><h3 class=p7>1998: THE BIG PIECE</h3><p class=p8>The largest and most significant section of Titanic ever recovered, this 17-ton section of the starboard side hull had fallen away from the Ship. It measures 26’ 6” across and was from C and D Decks. The top portion is on display at TITANIC: The Artifact Exhibition in Las Vegas and was part of the unoccupied cabins C-79 and C-81. The bottom portion, on display at TITANIC: The Artifact Exhibition in Orlando, was a part of the dishwashing and china storage rooms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Big-Piece.jpg><h3 class=p7>2000: SECOND CLASS DINING SALOON CHAIRBACK</h3><p class=p8>This wood fragment is part of a Second-Class dining saloon chairback with seat tag #191. Passengers could choose their dining room seat, but once they selected it, they were expected to remain there unless arrangements were made to change location.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wood-Fragment.jpg><h3 class=p7>2004: LIFEBOAT TURNBUCKLE</h3><p class=p8>In total, Titanic was equipped with 20 lifeboats, 14 of them were clinker-built wood lifeboats each lowered by two Welin davits. This piece is the lower half of a turnbuckle used to tighten the chains that secured the lifeboats to the Boat Deck while they were not being used.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Turnbuckle.jpg><p>Explore more artifacts at <a href=#>discovertitanic.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46foKecmaO0bsDIrZinoZNifnJ8jLKcmqqjYrynecSxp6WnopbBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffinding-titanic-110-years-of-exploration.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffinding-titanic-110-years-of-exploration.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffinding-titanic-110-years-of-exploration.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffinding-titanic-110-years-of-exploration.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffinding-titanic-110-years-of-exploration.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffinding-titanic-110-years-of-exploration.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./staud-moreau-bag-fashion-week-favourite.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./staud-moreau-bag-fashion-week-favourite.html>Introducing the 300 plant pot bag everyone is wearing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-painters-cant-wear-crocs-work-and-jackson.html>Why painters cant wear Crocs at work, and Jackson Pollocks spotless shoes: author Charlie Port</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-painters-cant-wear-crocs-work-and-jackson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
