Many&nbsp;believed the primary cause of the split was Israel's affair with&nbsp;Adrienne Bailon, his co-host of The Real. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, Israel was in no mood to blame Adrienne as he revealed his then-girlfriend had nothing to do with his split from Meleasa.</p><p style=text-align:justify>"My marriage had been over for quite some time before going public with my divorce announcement. It seems to be simple math that I had not even met Adrienne during the time my marriage was falling apart. Adrienne is a woman of integrity & character… Most of all she is a true friend, and she should not be blamed for my past indiscretions."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Following the confession of his sin, Israel even&nbsp;lost his job as a worship leader at Joel Osteen megachurch&nbsp;in March 2016.&nbsp;Further, in 2016, it was revealed that Israel had fathered two bastard children: Kingston and&nbsp;Khristian while he was still married to Meleasa.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In June 2016, his illegitimate kids' mother DeVawn Moreno&nbsp;sued Israel for child support payments.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Facing Same Legal Issues:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Fetty Wap Is Father To Baby Boy!

He said,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>I met Adrienne Bailon a bit over 2 years ago, we worked together & became friends. Our circles connected & we remained good friends. From a friendship, as two single adults we have very recently begun to explore a dating relationship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>The couple got married in Paris on 11 November&nbsp;2016, and Israel shared one of their wedding glimpses on Instagram.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Israel Haughton and&nbsp;Adrienne Bailon get married in France on 11 November 2016</strong> (Photo: Israel Houghton's Instagram)</p><p style=text-align:justify>In the meanwhile, Meleasa has not been involved with any boyfriend to post her divorce but is leading a self-content life with her three kids. Further, she enjoys flaunting her family time with children on social media.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Celeb Whose Spouse Remarried:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Neil Jackson Married, Girlfriend, Gay</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Following her daughter Mariah's wedding,&nbsp;she shared an Instagram video on 5 January&nbsp;2018&nbsp;which&nbsp;showed her children jamming together.

The home located in Harris County, Texas was&nbsp;once the family's residence.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Later in August&nbsp;2017, the matters got resolved after Israel found a buyer for the home, relieving him nearly $90,000 debt.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Moreover, Israel Houghton&nbsp;has an&nbsp;accumulated net worth&nbsp;of $8 million. So,&nbsp;there's a possibility that Meleasa's&nbsp;net worth after the divorce could be half of her ex-husband's net worth, i.e., $4 million.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Relishing Motherhood; Daughter Married Now</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Amid financial woes and a failed marriage, Meleasa found courage through her three children, who all mean different things to her.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Equal Number Of Children:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Mother of 3 Kids, Kym Marsh, About Her Pregnant Role: France Vacation With Boyfriend, Married Plans and Husband?</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Like most moms, she doesn't hold back when it comes to showering her kids with love on Instagram.

Like her, Mariah is also a married woman. Back in 2016,&nbsp;Mariah tied the knot with her boyfriend-turned-husband, Bryon.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her children aren't the only recipient of her social media love.
