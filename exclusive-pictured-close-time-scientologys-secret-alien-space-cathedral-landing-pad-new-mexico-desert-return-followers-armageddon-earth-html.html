Ron Hubbard, who wrote that 75 million years ago, an alien ruler called Xenu brought billions of his people to Earth in a spaceship and then killed them in a bomb blast, leaving their spirits to wander around and harm the living.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Following Scientology, according to Hubbard, means you can be clear of these malevolent spirits.</span></p><p><span>Scientology describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. One purpose of Scientology, as stated by the Church, is to become certain of one's spiritual existence and one's relationship to God, or the 'Supreme Being.'<br></span></p><p><span>To progress up the Scientology ladder, followers have to complete a number of courses and be 'Clear' in Dianetics. This is a state, according to Hubbard, when a human 'no longer has his own reactive mind and therefore suffers none of the ill-effects that the reactive mind can cause.'</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The Church believes that humans suffer unwanted and negative feelings, which lead to illnesses. If every person applies Dianetics in their life, they can be 'Clear', or free, of these feelings and therefore avoid sickness.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The next stage is to achieve Operating Thetan levels, or OTs for short. There are eight levels before the truth of Scientology can be fully revealed. It is believed that it took actor Tom Cruise five years and $100,000 to reach this level.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FdIWUa2puZ3WNkI2hsoKNfmWAnrC1wdGem2abnKTApnnToqSeZYOYtqa606ijqJ%2BpqHq0scKrnK1lkaG2prqMrKeam5VisKLAx56bq5mcYrmiusOipaBloJaxbprEsGSGnaiesLB5w56qnqqkYr%2BmwNSrpWaen6G5sMPEq6pmeaKirqixw52mp2V1lr%2B1tI2hq6ak</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-pictured-close-time-scientologys-secret-alien-space-cathedral-landing-pad-new-mexico-desert-return-followers-armageddon-earth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fexclusive-pictured-close-time-scientologys-secret-alien-space-cathedral-landing-pad-new-mexico-desert-return-followers-armageddon-earth-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-pictured-close-time-scientologys-secret-alien-space-cathedral-landing-pad-new-mexico-desert-return-followers-armageddon-earth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fexclusive-pictured-close-time-scientologys-secret-alien-space-cathedral-landing-pad-new-mexico-desert-return-followers-armageddon-earth-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-pictured-close-time-scientologys-secret-alien-space-cathedral-landing-pad-new-mexico-desert-return-followers-armageddon-earth-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-pictured-close-time-scientologys-secret-alien-space-cathedral-landing-pad-new-mexico-desert-return-followers-armageddon-earth-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joules-paddington-bear-collection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joules-paddington-bear-collection.html>Joules teams up with Paddington Bear on the cutest baby collection you've ever seen</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./danny-mastersons-wife-bijou-phillips-emotional-plea-to-judge-he-saved-my-life.html>Danny Masterson's wife Bijou Phillips' emotional plea to judge: 'He saved my life'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./danny-mastersons-wife-bijou-phillips-emotional-plea-to-judge-he-saved-my-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
